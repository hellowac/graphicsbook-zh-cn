<p>We have been talking about low-level graphics concepts like <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels.

In this subsection, I consider lines, rectangles, and ovals to be basic.</p>
<p>By "line," I really mean line segment, that is a straight line segment connecting two given points in the plane.

One of the first computer graphics algorithms, Bresenham's algorithm for line drawing, implements a very efficient procedure for doing so. I won't discuss such low-level details here, but it's worth looking them up if you want to start learning about what graphics hardware actually has to do on a low level. In any case, lines are typically more complicated. <abbr title="A technique used to reduce the jagged or &quot;staircase&quot; appearance of diagonal lines, text, and other shapes that are drawn using pixels. When a pixel is only partly covered by a geometric shape, then the color of the pixel is a blend of the color of the shape and the color of the background, with the degree of blending depending on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the geometric shape.">Antialiasing</abbr> is one complication. Line width is another. A wide line might actually be drawn as a rectangle.</p>
<p>Lines can have other <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>, or properties, that affect their appearance. One question is, what should happen at the end of a wide line? Appearance might be improved by adding a rounded "cap" on the ends of the line. A square cap—that is, extending the line by half of the line width—might also make sense. Another question is, when two lines meet as part of a larger shape, how should the lines be joined? And many graphics systems support lines that are patterns of dashes and dots. This illustration shows some of the possibilities:</p>
<p><figure markdown="span">

</figure></p>
<p>On the left are three wide lines with no cap, a round cap, and a square cap. The geometric line segment is shown as a dotted line. (The no-cap style is called "butt.") To the right are four lines with different patterns of dots and dashes. In the middle are three different styles of line joins: mitered, rounded, and beveled.</p>
<hr />
<p>The basic rectangular shape has sides that are vertical and horizontal. (A tilted rectangle generally has to be made by applying a <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>.) Such a rectangle can be specified with two points, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), that give the endpoints of one of the diagonals of the rectangle. Alternatively, the width and the height can be given, along with a single base point, (x,y). In that case, the width and height have to be positive, or the rectangle is empty. The base point (x,y) will be the upper left corner of the rectangle if y increases from top to bottom, and it will be the lower left corner of the rectangle if y increases from bottom to top.</p>
<p><figure markdown="span">

    <figcaption><abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> coordinates</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p>Suppose that you are given points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), and that you want to draw the rectangle that they determine. And suppose that the only rectangle-drawing command that you have available is one that requires a point (x,y), a width, and a height. For that command, x must be the smaller of x1 and x2, and the width can be computed as the absolute value of x1 minus x2. And similarly for y and the height. In pseudocode,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>DrawRectangle from points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2):
    x = min( x1, x2 )
    y = min( y1, y2 )
    width = abs( x1 - x2 )
    height = abs( y1 - y2 )
    DrawRectangle( x, y, width, height )
</code></pre></div>
<p>A common variation on rectangles is to allow rounded corners. For a "round rect," the corners are replaced by elliptical arcs. The degree of rounding can be specified by giving the horizontal radius and vertical radius of the ellipse. Here are some examples of round rects. For the shape at the right, the two radii of the ellipse are shown:</p>
<p><figure markdown="span">

</figure></p>
<p>My final basic shape is the oval. (An oval is also called an ellipse.) An oval is a closed curve that has two radii. For a basic oval, we assume that the radii are vertical and horizontal. An oval with this property can be specified by giving the rectangle that just contains it. Or it can be specified by giving its center point and the lengths of its vertical radius and its horizontal radius. In this illustration, the oval on the left is shown with its containing rectangle and with its center point and radii:</p>
<p><figure markdown="span">
    <a class="glightbox" href="../../../en/c2/ovals.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="pixel-coordinates" src="../../../en/c2/ovals.png" /></a>
    <figcaption><abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> coordinates</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p>The oval on the right is a circle. A circle is just an oval in which the two radii have the same length.</p>
<p>If ovals are not available as basic shapes, they can be approximated by drawing a large number of line segments. The number of lines that is needed for a good approximation depends on the size of the oval. It's useful to know how to do this. Suppose that an oval has center point (x,y), horizontal radius r1, and vertical radius r2. Mathematically, the points on the oval are given by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>( x + r1*cos(angle), y + r2*sin(angle) )
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <em>angle</em> takes on values from 0 to 360 if angles are measured in degrees or from 0 to 2π if they are measured in radians. Here sin and cos are the standard sine and cosine functions. To get an approximation for an oval, we can use this formula to generate some number of points and then connect those points with line segments. In pseudocode, assuming that angles are measured in radians and that <em>pi</em> represents the mathematical constant π,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Draw Oval with center (x,y), horizontal radius r1, and vertical radius r2:
    for i = 0 to numberOfLines:
        angle1 = i * (2*pi/numberOfLines)
        angle2 = (i+1) * (2*pi/numberOfLines)
        a1 = x + r1*cos(angle1)
        b1 = y + r2*sin(angle1)
        a2 = x + r1*cos(angle2)
        b2 = y + r2*sin(angle2)
        Draw Line from (a1,b1) to (a2,b2)
</code></pre></div>
<p>For a circle, of course, you would just have r1 = r2. This is the first time we have used the sine and cosine functions, but it won't be the last. These functions play an important role in computer graphics because of their association with circles, circular motion, and <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>. We will meet them again when we talk about transforms in the <a href="../s3/">next section</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a little demo that you can use to experiment with using line segments to approximate ovals:</p>

<p>There are two ways to make a shape visible in a drawing. You can stroke it. Or, if it is a closed shape such as a rectangle or an oval, you can fill it. Stroking a line is like dragging a pen along the line. Stroking a rectangle or oval is like dragging a pen along its boundary. Filling a shape means coloring all the points that are contained inside that shape. It's possible to both stroke and fill the same shape; in that case, the interior of the shape and the outline of the shape can have a different appearance.</p>
<p>When a shape intersects itself, like the two shapes in the illustration below, it's not entirely clear what should count as the interior of the shape. In fact, there are at least two different rules for filling such a shape. Both are based on something called the <abbr title="The winding number of a path about a point that does not lie on the path is the number of times that the path winds around the point, counting each 360-degree rotation in the positive direction about the point as one and each 360-degree turn in the negative direction as minus one. To compute the winding number, draw a ray extending from the point to infinity. Each crossing of the ray by the path counts as 1 if it crosses the ray going in the positive direction and as negative 1 if it crosses in the negative direction.">winding number</abbr>. The <abbr title="The winding number of a path about a point that does not lie on the path is the number of times that the path winds around the point, counting each 360-degree rotation in the positive direction about the point as one and each 360-degree turn in the negative direction as minus one. To compute the winding number, draw a ray extending from the point to infinity. Each crossing of the ray by the path counts as 1 if it crosses the ray going in the positive direction and as negative 1 if it crosses in the negative direction.">winding number</abbr> of a shape about a point is, roughly, how many times the shape winds around the point in the positive direction, which I take here to be counterclockwise. Winding number can be negative when the winding is in the opposite direction. In the illustration, the shapes on the left are traced in the direction shown, and the <abbr title="The winding number of a path about a point that does not lie on the path is the number of times that the path winds around the point, counting each 360-degree rotation in the positive direction about the point as one and each 360-degree turn in the negative direction as minus one. To compute the winding number, draw a ray extending from the point to infinity. Each crossing of the ray by the path counts as 1 if it crosses the ray going in the positive direction and as negative 1 if it crosses in the negative direction.">winding number</abbr> about each region is shown as a number inside the region.</p>

</figure></p>
<p>The shapes are also shown filled using the two fill rules. For the shapes in the center, the fill rule is to color any region that has a non-zero <abbr title="The winding number of a path about a point that does not lie on the path is the number of times that the path winds around the point, counting each 360-degree rotation in the positive direction about the point as one and each 360-degree turn in the negative direction as minus one. To compute the winding number, draw a ray extending from the point to infinity. Each crossing of the ray by the path counts as 1 if it crosses the ray going in the positive direction and as negative 1 if it crosses in the negative direction.">winding number</abbr>. For the shapes shown on the right, the rule is to color any region whose <abbr title="The winding number of a path about a point that does not lie on the path is the number of times that the path winds around the point, counting each 360-degree rotation in the positive direction about the point as one and each 360-degree turn in the negative direction as minus one. To compute the winding number, draw a ray extending from the point to infinity. Each crossing of the ray by the path counts as 1 if it crosses the ray going in the positive direction and as negative 1 if it crosses in the negative direction.">winding number</abbr> is odd; regions with even <abbr title="The winding number of a path about a point that does not lie on the path is the number of times that the path winds around the point, counting each 360-degree rotation in the positive direction about the point as one and each 360-degree turn in the negative direction as minus one. To compute the winding number, draw a ray extending from the point to infinity. Each crossing of the ray by the path counts as 1 if it crosses the ray going in the positive direction and as negative 1 if it crosses in the negative direction.">winding number</abbr> are not filled.</p>
<p>There is still the question of what a shape should be filled with. Of course, it can be filled with a color, but other types of fill are possible, including patterns and gradients. A pattern is an image, usually a small image. When used to fill a shape, a pattern can be repeated horizontally and vertically as necessary to cover the entire shape. A <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr> is similar in that it is a way for color to vary from point to point, but instead of taking the colors from an image, they are computed. There are a lot of variations to the basic idea, but there is always a line segment along which the color varies. The color is specified at the endpoints of the line segment, and possibly at additional points; between those points, the color is interpolated. The color can also be extrapolated to other points on the line that contains the line segment but lying outside the line segment; this can be done either by repeating the pattern from the line segment or by simply extending the color from the nearest endpoint. For a linear <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr>, the color is constant along lines perpendicular to the basic line segment, so you get lines of solid color going in that direction. In a radial <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr>, the color is constant along circles centered at one of the endpoints of the line segment. And that doesn't exhaust the possibilities. To give you an idea what patterns and gradients can look like, here is a shape, filled with two gradients and two patterns:</p>
<p><figure markdown="span">
    <a class="glightbox" href="../../../en/c2/filled-shapes.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="pixel-coordinates" src="../../../en/c2/filled-shapes.png" /></a>
</figure></p>
<p>The first shape is filled with a simple linear <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr> defined by just two colors, while the second shape uses a radial <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr>.</p>
<p>Patterns and gradients are not necessarily restricted to filling shapes. Stroking a shape is, after all, the same as filling a band of <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> along the boundary of the shape, and that can be done with a <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr> or a pattern, instead of with a solid color.</p>
<p>Finally, I will mention that a string of text can be considered to be a shape for the purpose of drawing it. The boundary of the shape is the outline of the characters. The text is drawn by filling that shape. In some graphics systems, it is also possible to stroke the outline of the shape that defines the text. In the following illustration, the string "Graphics" is shown, on top, filled with a pattern and, below that, filled with a <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points.

<p>Sometimes, polygons are required to be "simple," meaning that the <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr> has no self-intersections. That is, all the vertices are different, and a side can only intersect another side at its endpoints. And polygons are usually required to be "planar," meaning that all the vertices lie in the same plane. (Of course, in 2D graphics, everything lies in the same plane, so this is not an issue. However, it does become an issue in 3D.)</p>
<p>How then should we draw polygons? That is, what capabilities would we like to have in a graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> for drawing them. One possibility is to have commands for stroking and for filling polygons, where the vertices of the <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr> are given as an array of points or as an array of x-coordinates plus an array of y-coordinates. In fact, that is sometimes done; for example, the Java graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> includes such commands. Another, more flexible, approach is to introduce the idea of a "path." Java, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics. An XML language for specifying 2D vector graphics. SVG is a scene description language. It is designed to integrate into web pages.">SVG</abbr>, and the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language. A language that is used for specifying the content of web pages. An HTML document is made up of text, along with &quot;elements&quot; for adding other content, such as images, and for defining the structure of the document. Because of nesting of elements, the document can be represented by a tree-like data structure.">HTML</abbr> canvas <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> all support this idea. A path is a general shape that can include both line segments and curved segments. Segments can, but don't have to be, connected to other segments at their endpoints. A path is created by giving a series of commands that tell, essentially, how a pen would be moved to draw the path. While a path is being created, there is a point that represents the pen's current location. There will be a command for moving the pen without drawing, and commands for drawing various kinds of segments. For drawing polygons, we need commands such as</p>
<ul>
<li><code>createPath()</code> — start a new, empty path</li>
<li><code>moveTo(x,y)</code> — move the pen to the point (x,y), without adding a segment to the path; that is, without drawing anything</li>
<li><code>lineTo(x,y)</code> — add a line segment to the path that starts at the current pen location and ends at the point (x,y), and move the pen to (x,y)</li>
<li><code>closePath()</code> — add a line segment from the current pen location back to the starting point, unless the pen is already there, producing a closed path.</li>
</ul>
<p>(For closePath, I need to define "starting point." A path can be made up of "subpaths" A subpath consists of a series of connected segments. A moveTo always starts a new subpath. A closePath ends the current segment and implicitly starts a new one. So "starting point" means the position of the pen after the most recent moveTo or closePath.)</p>
<p>Suppose that we want a path that represents the triangle with vertices at (100,100), (300,100), and (200, 200). We can do that with the commands</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>createPath()
moveTo( 100, 100 )
lineTo( 300, 100 )
lineTo( 200, 200 )
closePath()
</code></pre></div>
<p>The closePath command at the end could be replaced by lineTo(100,100), to move the pen back to the first <abbr title="One of the points that define a geometric primitive, such as the two endpoints of a line segment or the three vertices of a triangle. (The plural is &quot;vertices.&quot;) A vertex can be specified in a coordinate system by giving its x and y coordinates in 2D graphics, or its x, y, and z coordinates in 3D graphics.">vertex</abbr>.</p>
<p>A path represents an abstract geometric object. Creating one does not make it visible on the screen. Once we have a path, to make it visible we need additional commands for stroking and filling the path.</p>
<p>Earlier in this section, we saw how to approximate an oval by drawing, in effect, a <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr> with a large number of sides. In that example, I drew each side as a separate line segment, so we really had a bunch of separate lines rather than a <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr>. There is no way to fill such a thing. It would be better to approximate the oval with a polygonal path. For an oval with center (x,y) and radii r1 and r2:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>createPath()
moveTo( x + r1, y )
for i = 1 to numberOfPoints-1
    angle = i * (2*pi/numberOfLines)
    lineTo( x + r1*cos(angle), y + r2*sin(angle) )
closePath()
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using this path, we could draw a filled oval as well as stroke it. Even if we just want to draw the outline of a <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr>, it's still better to create the <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr> as a path rather than to draw the line segments as separate sides. With a path, the computer knows that the sides are part of single shape. This makes it possible to control the appearance of the "join" between consecutive sides, as noted earlier in this section.</p>
<hr />
<p>I noted above that a path can contain other kinds of segments besides lines. For example, it might be possible to include an arc of a circle as a segment. Another type of curve is a <abbr title="A smooth curve between two points defined by parametric polynomial equations. A cubic Bezier curve segment is defined by its two endpoints P1 and P2 and by two control points C1 and C2. The tangent to the curve (its direction and speed) at P1 is given by the line from P1 to C1. The tangent vector to the curve at P2 is given by the line from C2 to P2.

Bezier curves can be used to create very general curved shapes. They are fairly intuitive, so that they are often used in programs that allow users to design curves interactively.

There are two kinds of <abbr title="A smooth curve between two points defined by parametric polynomial equations.

(Ordinarily, only the curve would be drawn, except in an interface that lets the user edit the curve by hand.)

<p>This would add a curve from the current location to point (x,y), using (cx1,cy1) and (cx2,cy2) as the control points. That is, the pen leaves the current location heading towards (cx1,cy1), and it ends at the point (x,y), arriving there from the direction of (cx2,cy2).</p>
