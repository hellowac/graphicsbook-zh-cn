<p>For 2D graphics, the world lies in a plane. It's not possible to show a picture of the entire infinite plane. We need to pick some rectangular area in the plane to display in the image. Let's call that rectangular area the window, or view <strong>window</strong>. A coordinate transform is used to map the window to the <abbr title="The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed.

<p>In this illustration, <strong>T</strong> represents the coordinate transformation. <strong>T</strong> is a function that takes <abbr title="The coordinate system in which a scene is defined.

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>T(x,y) = ( 800*(x+4)/8, 600*(3-y)/6 )
</code></pre></div>
<p>Look at the rectangle with corners at (-1,2) and (3,-1) in the window.

The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.">viewport</abbr>, it is displayed as the rectangle with corners <strong>T</strong>(-1,2) and <strong>T</strong>(3,-1).

<p>We use coordinate transformations in this way because it allows us to choose a world <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> that is natural for describing the scene that we want to display, and it is easier to do that than to work directly with <abbr title="The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed. The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.">viewport</abbr> coordinates. Along the same lines, suppose that we want to define some complex object, and suppose that there will be several copies of that object in our scene. Or maybe we are making an <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change.

<p>Remember that in order to view the scene, there will be another transformation that maps the object from a <abbr title="As used in this book, the window, or view window, for 2D graphics is the rectangle in the xy-plane that contains the portion of the plane that will be displayed in the image.

The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.">viewport</abbr>.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that the choice of a <abbr title="As used in this book, the window, or view window, for 2D graphics is the rectangle in the xy-plane that contains the portion of the plane that will be displayed in the image. (The corresponding term in 3D graphics is &quot;view volume.&quot;)">view window</abbr> tells which part of the scene is shown in the image. Moving, resizing, or even rotating the window will give a different view of the scene. Suppose we make several images of the same car:</p>
<p><figure markdown="span">
    <a class="glightbox" href="../../../en/c2/modeling-or-viewing-2d.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="pixel-coordinates" src="../../../en/c2/modeling-or-viewing-2d.png" /></a>
</figure></p>
<p>What happened between making the top image in this illustration and making the image on the bottom left? In fact, there are two possibilities: Either the car was moved to the right, or the <abbr title="As used in this book, the window, or view window, for 2D graphics is the rectangle in the xy-plane that contains the portion of the plane that will be displayed in the image. (The corresponding term in 3D graphics is &quot;view volume.&quot;)">view window</abbr> that defines the scene was moved to the left. This is important, so be sure you understand it. (Try it with your cell phone <abbr title="In 3D computer graphics, an object that combines the projection and viewing transforms into an abstraction that imitates a physical camera or eye.">camera</abbr>. Aim it at some objects, take a step to the left, and notice what happens to the objects in the <abbr title="In 3D computer graphics, an object that combines the projection and viewing transforms into an abstraction that imitates a physical camera or eye.">camera</abbr>'s viewfinder: They move to the right in the picture!) Similarly, what happens between the top picture and the middle picture on the bottom? Either the car rotated counterclockwise, or the window was rotated clockwise. (Again, try it with a <abbr title="In 3D computer graphics, an object that combines the projection and viewing transforms into an abstraction that imitates a physical camera or eye.">camera</abbr>—you might want to take two actual photos so that you can compare them.) Finally, the change from the top picture to the one on the bottom right could happen because the car got smaller or because the window got larger. (On your <abbr title="In 3D computer graphics, an object that combines the projection and viewing transforms into an abstraction that imitates a physical camera or eye.">camera</abbr>, a bigger window means that you are seeing a larger field of view, and you can get that by applying a zoom to the <abbr title="In 3D computer graphics, an object that combines the projection and viewing transforms into an abstraction that imitates a physical camera or eye.">camera</abbr> or by backing up away from the objects that you are <abbr title="Setting the position and orientation of the viewer in a 3D world, which determine what will be visible when the 2D image of a 3D world is rendered.">viewing</abbr>.)</p>
<p>There is an important general idea here. When we modify the <abbr title="As used in this book, the window, or view window, for 2D graphics is the rectangle in the xy-plane that contains the portion of the plane that will be displayed in the image. (The corresponding term in 3D graphics is &quot;view volume.&quot;)">view window</abbr>, we change the <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> that is applied to the <abbr title="The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed. The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.">viewport</abbr>. But in fact, this is the same as leaving that <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> in place and moving the objects in the scene instead. Except that to get the same effect in the final image, you have to apply the opposite transformation to the objects (for example, moving the window to the left is equivalent to moving the objects to the right). So, there is no essential distinction between transforming the window and transforming the object. Mathematically, you specify a <abbr title="Geometric objects in a graphics system, such as OpenGL, that are not made up of simpler objects. Examples in OpenGL include points, lines, and triangles, but the set of available primitives depends on the graphics system. (Note that as the term is used in OpenGL, a single primitive can be made up of many points, line segments, or triangles.)">geometric primitive</abbr> by giving coordinates in some natural <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>, and the computer applies a sequence of transformations to those coordinates to produce, in the end, the coordinates that are used to actually draw the primitive in the image. You will think of some of those transformations as modeling transforms and some as coordinate transforms, but to the computer, it's all the same.</p>
<p>Here is a live demo that can help you to understand the equivalence between modeling transformations and <abbr title="The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed. The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.">viewport</abbr> transformations. The sliders control transformations that are applied to the objects in the picture. In the lower section of the demo, you see a larger view in which the <abbr title="The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed. The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.">viewport</abbr> for the upper image is represented as a translucent black rectangle.

<p>We will return to this idea several times later in the book, but in any case, you can see that geometric transforms are a central concept in computer graphics. Let's look at some basic types of transformation in more detail. The transforms we will use in 2D graphics can be written in the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>x1 = a*x + b*y + e
y1 = c*x + d*y + f
</code></pre></div>
<p>where (x,y) represents the coordinates of some point before the transformation is applied, and (x1,y1) are the transformed coordinates. The transform is defined by the six constants a, b, c, d, e, and f. Note that this can be written as a function <strong>T</strong>, where</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>T(x,y) = ( a*x + b*y + e, c*x + d*y + f )
</code></pre></div>
<p>A transformation of this form is called an <strong><abbr title="A transform that preserves parallel lines. That is, when the transform is applied to a pair of lines that are parallel, then the resulting transformed lines are also parallel. An affine transform, T, has the property that the transform of the line segment between a point (x1,y1) and a point (x2,y2) is the line between the points T(x1,y1) and T(x2,y2).

If you say translate(4,2) before drawing the "F", then every point of the "F" will be moved horizontally by 4 units and vertically by 2 units before the coordinates are actually used, so that after the <abbr title="A geometric transform that adds a given translation amount to each coordinate of a point.

<p>Also remember that you don't compute coordinate transformations yourself. You just specify the original coordinates for the object (that is, the <abbr title="The coordinate system in which the coordinates for points in an object are originally specified, before they are transformed by any modeling or other transform that will be applied to the object.">object coordinates</abbr>), and you specify the transform or transforms that are to be applied.

<p>We are now in a position to see what can happen when you combine two transformations. Suppose that before drawing some object, you say</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>translate(4,0)
rotate(90)
‵‵‵

Assume that angles are measured in degrees. The translation will then apply to all subsequent drawing. But, because of the rotation command, the things that you draw after the translation are rotated objects. That is, the translation applies to objects that have already been rotated. An example is shown on the left in the illustration below, where the light gray &quot;F&quot; is the original shape, and red &quot;F&quot; shows the result of applying the two transforms to the original. The original &quot;F&quot; was first rotated through a 90 degree angle, and then moved 4 units to the right.

&lt;figure markdown=&quot;span&quot;&gt;
    ![pixel-coordinates](../../en/c2/rotate-and-translate-2d.png)
&lt;/figure&gt;

Note that transforms are applied to objects in the reverse of the order in which they are given in the code (because the first transform in the code is applied to an object that has already been affected by the second transform). And note that the order in which the transforms are applied is important. If we reverse the order in which the two transforms are applied in this example, by saying

```text
rotate(90)
translate(4,0)
‵‵‵

then the result is as shown on the right in the above illustration. In that picture, the original &quot;F&quot; is first moved 4 units to the right and the resulting shape is then rotated through an angle of 90 degrees about the origin to give the shape that actually appears on the screen.

For another example of applying several transformations, suppose that we want to rotate a shape through an angle r about a point (p,q) instead of about the point (0,0). We can do this by first moving the point (p,q) to the origin, using translate(-p,-q). Then we can do a standard rotation about the origin by calling rotate(r). Finally, we can move the origin back to the point (p,q) by applying translate(p,q). Keeping in mind that we have to write the code for the transformations in the reverse order, we need to say

```text
translate(p,q)
rotate(r)
translate(-p,-q)
</code></pre></div>
<p>before drawing the shape. (In fact, some graphics APIs let us accomplish this transform with a single command such as rotate(r,p,q). This would apply a <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr> through the angle r about the point (p,q).)</p>

<p>We will look at one more type of basic transform, a shearing transform. Although shears can in fact be built up out of rotations and scalings if necessary, it is not really obvious how to do so.

<p>The transforms that are used in computer graphics can be represented as matrices, and the points on which they operate are represented as vectors. Recall that a <strong><abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Matrices and vectors are studied in the field of mathematics called <strong><abbr title="The field of mathematics that studies vector spaces and linear transformations between them. Linear algebra is part of the essential mathematical foundation of computer graphics.">linear algebra</abbr></strong>. Linear algebra is fundamental to computer graphics. In fact, <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns.

You won't need to know a great deal about <abbr title="The field of mathematics that studies vector spaces and linear transformations between them. Linear algebra is part of the essential mathematical foundation of computer graphics.">linear algebra</abbr> for this textbook, but a few basic ideas are essential.</p>
<p>The vectors that we need are lists of two, three, or four numbers. They are often written as (x,y), (x,y,z), and (x,y,z,w). A <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> with N rows and M columns is called an "N-by-M <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>." For the most part, the matrices that we need are N-by-N matrices, where N is 2, 3, or 4. That is, they have 2, 3, or 4 rows and columns, and the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.</p>
<p>If A and B are two N-by-N matrices, then they can be multiplied to give a product <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> C = AB. If A is an N-by-N <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>, and v is a <abbr title="An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers. Vectors in that sense are often used to represent points in 2D, 3D, or 4D space. Properly, however, a vector represents a quantity that has a length and a direction; a vector used in this way can be visualized as an arrow.">vector</abbr> of length N, then v can be multiplied by A to give another <abbr title="An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers. Vectors in that sense are often used to represent points in 2D, 3D, or 4D space. Properly, however, a vector represents a quantity that has a length and a direction; a vector used in this way can be visualized as an arrow.">vector</abbr> w = Av. The function that takes v to Av is a transformation; it transforms any given <abbr title="An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers. Vectors in that sense are often used to represent points in 2D, 3D, or 4D space.

Properly, however, a vector represents a quantity that has a length and a direction; a vector used in this way can be visualized as an arrow.">vector</abbr> of size N. A transformation of this form is called a <strong><abbr title="A function from one vector space to another that preserves vector addition and multiplication by constants. Linear transformations can be represented by matrices. In computer graphics, they are used to implement geometric operations such as rotation and translation.">linear transformation</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that A and B are N-by-N matrices and v is a <abbr title="An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers. Vectors in that sense are often used to represent points in 2D, 3D, or 4D space. Properly, however, a vector represents a quantity that has a length and a direction; a vector used in this way can be visualized as an arrow.">vector</abbr> of length N. Then, we can form two different products: A(Bv) and (AB)v. It is a central fact that these two operations have the same effect. That is, we can multiply v by B and then multiply the result by A, or we can multiply the matrices A and B to get the <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> product AB and then multiply v by AB. The result is the same.</p>
<p>Rotation and <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin. Scaling can be uniform—the same in every direction—or non-uniform—with a different scaling factor in each coordinate direction. A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr>, as it turns out, are linear transformations. That is, the operation of rotating (x,y) through an angle d about the origin can be done by multiplying (x,y) by a 2-by-2 <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>. Let's call that <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> Rd. Similarly, <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin. Scaling can be uniform—the same in every direction—or non-uniform—with a different scaling factor in each coordinate direction. A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr> by a factor a in the horizontal direction and b in the vertical direction can be given as a <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> Sa,b. If we want to apply a <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin. Scaling can be uniform—the same in every direction—or non-uniform—with a different scaling factor in each coordinate direction. A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr> followed by a <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr> to the point v = (x,y), we can compute <strong>either</strong> Rd(Sa,b^v) or (RdSa,b)v.</p>
<p>So what? Well, suppose that we want to apply the same two operations, scale then rotate, to thousands of points, as we typically do when transforming objects for computer graphics. The point is that we could compute the product <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> RdSa,b once and for all, and then apply the combined transform to each point with a single multiplication. This means that if a program says</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rotate(d)
scale(a,b)
.
.  // draw a complex object

</code></pre></div>
<p>the computer doesn't have to keep track of two separate operations. It combines the operations into a single <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> and just keeps track of that. Even if you apply, say, 50 transformations to the object, the computer can just combine them all into one <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>. By using <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> algebra, multiple transformations can be handled as efficiently as a single transformation!</p>
<p>This is really nice, but there is a gaping problem: <strong>Translation is not a <abbr title="A function from one vector space to another that preserves vector addition and multiplication by constants. Linear transformations can be represented by matrices. In computer graphics, they are used to implement geometric operations such as rotation and translation.">linear transformation</abbr></strong>. To bring <abbr title="A geometric transform that adds a given translation amount to each coordinate of a point. Translation is used to move objects without changing their size or orientation.">translation</abbr> into this framework, we do something that looks a little strange at first: Instead of representing a point in 2D as a pair of numbers (x,y), we represent it as the triple of numbers (x,y,1). That is, we add a one as the third coordinate. It then turns out that we can then represent <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>, <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin. Scaling can be uniform—the same in every direction—or non-uniform—with a different scaling factor in each coordinate direction. A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr>, and <abbr title="A geometric transform that adds a given translation amount to each coordinate of a point. Translation is used to move objects without changing their size or orientation.">translation</abbr>—and hence any affine transformation—on 2D space as multiplication by a 3-by-3 <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>. The matrices that we need have a bottom row containing (0,0,1). Multiplying (x,y,1) by such a <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> gives a new <abbr title="An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers.

We ignore the extra coordinate and consider this to be a transformation of (x,y) into (x1,y1).

<p>You can compare multiplication by these matrices to the formulas given above for <abbr title="A geometric transform that adds a given translation amount to each coordinate of a point. Translation is used to move objects without changing their size or orientation.">translation</abbr>, <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin.

A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr>, and <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>. But when doing graphics programming, you won't need to do the multiplication yourself. For now, the important idea that you should take away from this discussion is that a sequence of transformations can be combined into a single transformation. The computer only needs to keep track of a single <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>, which we can call the "current <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr>" or "current transformation." To implement transform commands such as translate(a,b) or rotate(d), the computer simply multiplies the current <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional array, with numbers arranged in rows and columns. An N-by-N matrix represents a linear transformation from N-dimensional space to itself.">matrix</abbr> by the <abbr title="A rectangular array of numbers.
