<p>The element starts with a "start tag," which begins with a "<code>&lt;</code>" followed by an identifier that is the name of the tag, and ending with a "<code>&gt;</code>". The start tag can include "<abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>," which have the form <code>name="value"</code>. The name is an identifier; the value is a string. The value must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks. The element ends with an "end tag," which has an element name that matches the element name in the start tag and has the form <code>&lt;/elementname&gt;</code>. Element names and <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> names are case-sensitive. Between the start and end tags comes the "content" of the element. The content can consist of text and nested elements. If an element has no content, you can replace the "<code>&gt;</code>" at the end of the start tag with "<code>/&gt;</code>", and leave out the end tag. This is called a "self-closing tag." For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;circle</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">cx=</span><span class="s">&quot;5&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">cy=</span><span class="s">&quot;5&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">r=</span><span class="s">&quot;4&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">fill=</span><span class="s">&quot;red&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

<p>Looking back at the <abbr title="可缩放矢量图形。一种用于指定2D矢量图形的XML语言。SVG是一种场景描述语言。它旨在集成到网页中。">SVG</abbr> document, the five lines starting with <code>&lt;svg</code> are just a long start tag. You can use the tag as shown, and customize the values of the width, height, viewBox, and preserveAspectRatio <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object.

It can be forced into a different size, for example if it is used in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element on a web page that specifies a different width and height. The size can be specified using units of measure such as <em>in</em> for inches, cm for centimeters, and px, for <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels.

<p>The <em>viewBox</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object.

It is what I called the <abbr title="As used in this book, the window, or view window, for 2D graphics is the rectangle in the xy-plane that contains the portion of the plane that will be displayed in the image. (The corresponding term in 3D graphics is &quot;view volume.&quot;)">view window</abbr> in <a href="../s3/#231--视口和建模">Subsection 2.3.1</a>.

The width and the height must be positive, so x increases from left-to-right, and y increases from top-to-bottom.

<p>Finally, the preserveAspectRatio <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object.

<p>Style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> can be added to say how the shape should be stroked and filled. The default is to use a black fill and no stroke. (More precisely, as we will see later, the default is for a shape to inherit the values of style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> from its environment. Black fill and no stroke is the initial environment.) Here are some common style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fill</code> — specifies how to fill the shape. The value can be "none" to indicate that the shape is not filled. It can be a color, in the same format as the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets. A language that is used for specifying the style, or presentation, of the content of web pages. CSS can control things like colors, backgrounds, fonts, shadows, borders, and the size and position of elements of the page.">CSS</abbr> colors that are used in the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language.

Because of nesting of elements, the document can be represented by a tree-like data structure.">HTML</abbr> canvas <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr>. For example, it can be a common color name such as "black" or "red", or an <abbr title="A color specified by three numbers giving the amount of red, green, and blue in the color.">RGB color</abbr> such as "rgb(255,200,180)". There are also <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr> and pattern fills, though I will not discuss them here.</li>
<li><code>stroke</code> — specifies how to stroke the shape, with the same possible values as "fill".
stroke-opacity and fill-opacity — are numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that specify the opacity of the stroke and fill. Values less than 1.0 give a translucent stroke or fill. The default value, 1.0, means fully opaque.</li>
<li><code>stroke-width</code> — is a number that sets the line width to use for the stroke. Note that the line width is subject to transforms. The default value is "1", which is fine if the <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> is using <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> as the unit of measure, but often too wide in custom <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate systems</abbr>.</li>
<li><code>stroke-linecap</code> — determines the appearance of the endpoints of a stroke. The value can be "square", "round", or "butt". The default is "butt". (See <a href="../s2/#221--基本形状">Subsection 2.2.1</a> for a discussion of line caps and joins.)</li>
<li><code>stroke-linejoin</code> — determines the appearance of points where two segments of a stroke meet. The values can be "miter", "round", or "bevel". The default is "miter".</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example that uses many of these options, let's make a square that is rounded rather than pointed at the corners, with size 1, centered at the origin, and using a translucent red fill and a gray stroke:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x=</span><span class="s">&quot;-0.5&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">y=</span><span class="s">&quot;-0.5&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>and a simple outline of a rectangle with no fill:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;200&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">stroke=</span><span class="s">&quot;black&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">fill=</span><span class="s">&quot;none&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr />
<p>The <em>transform</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> can be used to apply a transform or a series of transforms to a shape. As an example, we can make a rectangle tilted 30 degrees from the horizontal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;rotate(30)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The value "rotate(30)" represents a <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr> of 30 degrees (not radians!) about the origin, (0,0). The positive direction of <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>, as usual, rotates the positive x-axis in the direction of the positive y-axis. You can specify a different center of <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr> by adding arguments to rotate. For example, to rotate the same rectangle about its center</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;rotate(30,50,25)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Translation and <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin. Scaling can be uniform—the same in every direction—or non-uniform—with a different scaling factor in each coordinate direction. A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr> work as you probably expect, with transform values of the form "translate(dx,dy)" and "scale(sx,sy)". There are also shear transforms, but they go by the names <em>skewX</em> and <em>skewY</em>, and the argument is a skew angle rather than a shear amount. For example, the transform "skewX(45)" tilts the y-axis by 45 degrees and is equivalent to an x-shear with shear factor 1. (The function that tilts the y-axis is called <em>skewX</em> because it modifies, or skews, the x-coordinates of points while leaving their y-coordinates unchanged.) For example, we can use <em>skewX</em> to tilt a rectangle and make it into a parallelogram:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;skewX(-30)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I used an angle of -30 degrees to make the rectangle tilt to the right in the usual <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>.</p>
<p>The value of the <em>transform</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> can be a list of transforms, separated by spaces or commas. The transforms are applied to the object, as usual, in the opposite of the order in which they are listed. So,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;translate(0,50) rotate(45) skewX(-30)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>would first skew the rectangle into a parallelogram, then rotate the parallelogram by 45 degrees about the origin, then translate it by 50 units in the y-direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition to rectangles, <abbr title="可缩放矢量图形。一种用于指定2D矢量图形的XML语言。SVG是一种场景描述语言。它旨在集成到网页中。">SVG</abbr> has lines, circles, ellipses, and text as basic shapes. Here are some details. A <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> element represents a line segement and has geometric <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> x1, y1, x2, and y2 to specify the coordinates of the endpoints of the line segment. These four <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> have zero as default value, which makes it easier to specify horizontal and vertical lines. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;line</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x1=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x2=</span><span class="s">&quot;300&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">stroke=</span><span class="s">&quot;black&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Without the <em>stroke</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr>, you wouldn't see the line, since the default value for <em>stoke</em> is "none".</p>
<p>For a <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> element, the geometric <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> are cx, cy, and r giving the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius. The center coordinates have default values equal to zero. For an <code>&lt;ellipse&gt;</code> element, the <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> are cx, cy, rx, and ry, where rx and ry give the radii of the ellipse in the x- and y-directions.</p>
<p>A <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element is a little different. It has <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> x and y, with default values zero, to specify the location of the basepoint of the text. However, the text itself is given as the content of the element rather than as an <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr>. That is, the element is divided into a start tag and an end tag, and the text that will appear in the drawing comes between the start and end tags. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;text</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x=</span><span class="s">&quot;10&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">y=</span><span class="s">&quot;30&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>This<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="w"> </span>will<span class="w"> </span>appear<span class="w"> </span>in<span class="w"> </span>the<span class="w"> </span>image<span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&lt;/text&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The usual stroke and fill <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> apply to text, but text has additional style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>. The <em>font-family</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> specifies the font itself. Its value can be one of the generic font names "serif", "sans-serif", "monospace", or the name of a specific font that is available on the system. The <em>font-size</em> can be a number giving the (approximate) height of the characters in the <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>. (Font size is subject to coordinate and modeling transforms like any other length.) You can get bold and italic text by setting <em>font-weight</em> equal to "bold" and <em>font-style</em> equal to "italic". Here is an example that uses all of these options, and applies some additional styles and a transform for good measure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;text</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x=</span><span class="s">&quot;10&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">y=</span><span class="s">&quot;30&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>

<p>Style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> can be added to say how the shape should be stroked and filled. The default is to use a black fill and no stroke. (More precisely, as we will see later, the default is for a shape to inherit the values of style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> from its environment. Black fill and no stroke is the initial environment.) Here are some common style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fill</code> — specifies how to fill the shape. The value can be "none" to indicate that the shape is not filled. It can be a color, in the same format as the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets. A language that is used for specifying the style, or presentation, of the content of web pages. CSS can control things like colors, backgrounds, fonts, shadows, borders, and the size and position of elements of the page.">CSS</abbr> colors that are used in the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language. A language that is used for specifying the content of web pages. An HTML document is made up of text, along with &quot;elements&quot; for adding other content, such as images, and for defining the structure of the document. Because of nesting of elements, the document can be represented by a tree-like data structure.">HTML</abbr> canvas <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr>. For example, it can be a common color name such as "black" or "red", or an <abbr title="A color specified by three numbers giving the amount of red, green, and blue in the color.">RGB color</abbr> such as "rgb(255,200,180)". There are also <abbr title="A pattern of color produced by assigning colors to certain reference points and computing color for other points by interpolating or extrapolating colors from the reference points. The effect is a color progression along line segments between reference points. Different rules for extending the colors beyond those lines produce different types of gradient, such as linear gradients and radial gradients.">gradient</abbr> and pattern fills, though I will not discuss them here.</li>
<li><code>stroke</code> — specifies how to stroke the shape, with the same possible values as "fill".
stroke-opacity and fill-opacity — are numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that specify the opacity of the stroke and fill. Values less than 1.0 give a translucent stroke or fill. The default value, 1.0, means fully opaque.</li>
<li><code>stroke-width</code> — is a number that sets the line width to use for the stroke. Note that the line width is subject to transforms. The default value is "1", which is fine if the <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> is using <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> as the unit of measure, but often too wide in custom <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate systems</abbr>.</li>
<li><code>stroke-linecap</code> — determines the appearance of the endpoints of a stroke. The value can be "square", "round", or "butt". The default is "butt". (See <a href="../s2/#221--基本形状">Subsection 2.2.1</a> for a discussion of line caps and joins.)</li>
<li><code>stroke-linejoin</code> — determines the appearance of points where two segments of a stroke meet. The values can be "miter", "round", or "bevel". The default is "miter".</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example that uses many of these options, let's make a square that is rounded rather than pointed at the corners, with size 1, centered at the origin, and using a translucent red fill and a gray stroke:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x=</span><span class="s">&quot;-0.5&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">y=</span><span class="s">&quot;-0.5&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>and a simple outline of a rectangle with no fill:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;200&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">stroke=</span><span class="s">&quot;black&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">fill=</span><span class="s">&quot;none&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr />
<p>The <em>transform</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> can be used to apply a transform or a series of transforms to a shape. As an example, we can make a rectangle tilted 30 degrees from the horizontal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;rotate(30)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The value "rotate(30)" represents a <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr> of 30 degrees (not radians!) about the origin, (0,0). The positive direction of <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>, as usual, rotates the positive x-axis in the direction of the positive y-axis. You can specify a different center of <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr> by adding arguments to rotate. For example, to rotate the same rectangle about its center</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;rotate(30,50,25)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Translation and <abbr title="A geometric transform that multiplies each coordinate of a point by a number called the scaling factor. Scaling increases or decreases the size of an object, but also moves its points closer to or farther from the origin. Scaling can be uniform—the same in every direction—or non-uniform—with a different scaling factor in each coordinate direction. A negative scaling factor can be used to apply a reflection.">scaling</abbr> work as you probably expect, with transform values of the form "translate(dx,dy)" and "scale(sx,sy)". There are also shear transforms, but they go by the names <em>skewX</em> and <em>skewY</em>, and the argument is a skew angle rather than a shear amount. For example, the transform "skewX(45)" tilts the y-axis by 45 degrees and is equivalent to an x-shear with shear factor 1. (The function that tilts the y-axis is called <em>skewX</em> because it modifies, or skews, the x-coordinates of points while leaving their y-coordinates unchanged.) For example, we can use <em>skewX</em> to tilt a rectangle and make it into a parallelogram:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;skewX(-30)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I used an angle of -30 degrees to make the rectangle tilt to the right in the usual <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>.</p>
<p>The value of the <em>transform</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> can be a list of transforms, separated by spaces or commas. The transforms are applied to the object, as usual, in the opposite of the order in which they are listed. So,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;50&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;translate(0,50) rotate(45) skewX(-30)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>would first skew the rectangle into a parallelogram, then rotate the parallelogram by 45 degrees about the origin, then translate it by 50 units in the y-direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition to rectangles, <abbr title="可缩放矢量图形。一种用于指定2D矢量图形的XML语言。SVG是一种场景描述语言。它旨在集成到网页中。">SVG</abbr> has lines, circles, ellipses, and text as basic shapes. Here are some details. A <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> element represents a line segement and has geometric <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> x1, y1, x2, and y2 to specify the coordinates of the endpoints of the line segment. These four <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> have zero as default value, which makes it easier to specify horizontal and vertical lines. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;line</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x1=</span><span class="s">&quot;100&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x2=</span><span class="s">&quot;300&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">stroke=</span><span class="s">&quot;black&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Without the <em>stroke</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr>, you wouldn't see the line, since the default value for <em>stoke</em> is "none".</p>
<p>For a <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> element, the geometric <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> are cx, cy, and r giving the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius. The center coordinates have default values equal to zero. For an <code>&lt;ellipse&gt;</code> element, the <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> are cx, cy, rx, and ry, where rx and ry give the radii of the ellipse in the x- and y-directions.</p>
<p>A <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element is a little different. It has <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> x and y, with default values zero, to specify the location of the basepoint of the text. However, the text itself is given as the content of the element rather than as an <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr>. That is, the element is divided into a start tag and an end tag, and the text that will appear in the drawing comes between the start and end tags. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;text</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x=</span><span class="s">&quot;10&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">y=</span><span class="s">&quot;30&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>This<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="w"> </span>will<span class="w"> </span>appear<span class="w"> </span>in<span class="w"> </span>the<span class="w"> </span>image<span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&lt;/text&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The usual stroke and fill <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> apply to text, but text has additional style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>. The <em>font-family</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> specifies the font itself. Its value can be one of the generic font names "serif", "sans-serif", "monospace", or the name of a specific font that is available on the system. The <em>font-size</em> can be a number giving the (approximate) height of the characters in the <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>. (Font size is subject to coordinate and modeling transforms like any other length.) You can get bold and italic text by setting <em>font-weight</em> equal to "bold" and <em>font-style</em> equal to "italic". Here is an example that uses all of these options, and applies some additional styles and a transform for good measure:</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element is much more interesting. In fact, all of the other basic shapes, except text, could be made using path elements. A path can consist of line segments, Bezier curves, and elliptical arcs (although I won't discuss elliptical arcs here). The syntax for specifying a path is very succinct, and it has some features that we have not seen before. A path element has an <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object.

The data consists of one or more commands, where each command consists of a single letter followed by any data necessary for the command. The moveTo, lineTo, cubic Bezier, and quadratic Bezier commands that you are already familiar with are coded by the letters M, L, C, and Q. The command for closing a path segment is Z, and it requires no data. For example the path data "M 10 20 L 100 200" would draw a line segment from the point (10,20) to the point (100,200). You can combine several connected line segments into one L command. For example, the <code>&lt;polygon&gt;</code> example given above could be created using the <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">&quot;M 0,0 L 100,0 100,75 50,100 0,75 Z&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Z at the end of the data closes the path by adding the final side to the <abbr title="A multi-sided shape lying in a plane and specified by a list of points, called its vertices, and made up of the line segments from each point in the list to the next point in the list, plus a line segment from the last point in the list to the first point. All the points are required to lie in the same plane. Sometimes the term &quot;polygon&quot; includes the interior of the shape as well as its boundary.">polygon</abbr>. (Note that, as usual, you can use either commas or spaces in the data.)</p>
<p>The C command takes six numbers as data, to specify the two control points and the final endpoint of the cubic <abbr title="A smooth curve between two points defined by parametric polynomial equations. A cubic Bezier curve segment is defined by its two endpoints P1 and P2 and by two control points C1 and C2.

A quadratic Bezier curve is defined by its two endpoints and a single control point C. The tangent at each endpoint is the line between that endpoint and C.">Bezier curve</abbr> segment. You can also give a multiple of six values to get a connected sequence of curve segements. Similarly, the Q command uses four data values to specify the <abbr title="A point that does not lie on the curve but that is used to help control the shape of the curve. For example, a control point for a Bezier curve segment is used to specify the tangent vector (direction and speed) of the curve at an endpoint.">control point</abbr> and final endpoint of the quadratic <abbr title="A smooth curve between two points defined by parametric polynomial equations. A cubic Bezier curve segment is defined by its two endpoints P1 and P2 and by two control points C1 and C2.

<p><abbr title="可缩放矢量图形。一种用于指定2D矢量图形的XML语言。SVG是一种场景描述语言。它旨在集成到网页中。">SVG</abbr> paths add flexibility by defining "relative" versions of the path commands, where the data for the command is given relative to the current position. A relative move command, for example, instead of telling where to move, tells how far to move from the current position. The names of the relative versions of the path commands are lower case letters instead of upper case. "M 10,20" means to move to the point with coordinates (10,20), while "m 10,20" means to move 10 units horizontally and 20 units vertically from the current position. Similarly, if the current position is (x,y), then the command "l 3,5", where the first character is a lower case L, draws a line from (x,y) to (x+3,y+5).</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element is much more interesting. In fact, all of the other basic shapes, except text, could be made using path elements. A path can consist of line segments, Bezier curves, and elliptical arcs (although I won't discuss elliptical arcs here).

</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element can then be used to add a copy of the plus sign object to the scene. The syntax is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">xlink:href=</span><span class="s">&quot;#plus&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The value of the xlink:href <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> must be the id of the object, with a "#" character added at the beginning. (Don't forget the #. If you leave it out, the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element will simply be ignored.) You can add a transform <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> to the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element to apply a transformation to the copy of the object. You can also apply style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr>, which will be used as default values for the <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> in the copy. For example, we can draw several plus signs with different transforms and stroke widths:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">xlink:href=</span><span class="s">&quot;#plus&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;translate(50,20)&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">stroke-width=</span><span class="s">&quot;5&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">xlink:href=</span><span class="s">&quot;#plus&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">transform=</span><span class="s">&quot;translate(0,30) rotate(45)&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that we can't change the color of the plus sign, since it already specifies its own stroke color.</p>
<p>An object that has been defined in the <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> section can also be used as a sub-object in other object definitions. This makes it possible to create a hierarchy with multiple levels. Here is an example from <a href="../../../en/source/svg/svg-hierarchy.svg">svg/svg-hierarchy.svg</a> that defines a "wheel" object, then uses two copies of the wheel as sub-objects in a "cart" object:</p>

<p>A <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element can then be used to add a copy of the plus sign object to the scene. The syntax is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">xlink:href=</span><span class="s">&quot;#plus&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

<p>The value of the xlink:href <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> must be the id of the object, with a "#" character added at the beginning. (Don't forget the #. If you leave it out, the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element will simply be ignored.) You can add a transform <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> to the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element to apply a transformation to the copy of the object. You can also apply style <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object.

For example, we can draw several plus signs with different transforms and stroke widths:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>An object that has been defined in the <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> section can also be used as a sub-object in other object definitions. This makes it possible to create a hierarchy with multiple levels.

<p>What if we want the rectangle to move back and forth between its initial and final position?

<p>The <em>keyTimes</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> is a list of numbers, separated by semicolons. The numbers are in the range 0 to 1, and should be in increasing order. The first number should be 0 and the last number should be 1. A number specifies a time during the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, as a fraction of the complete <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>. For example, 0.5 is a point half-way through the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, and 0.75 is three-quarters of the way. The <em>values</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> is a list of values, with one value for each key time. In this case, the value for x is 0 at the start of the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, 430 half-way through the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, and 0 again at the end of the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>. Between the key times, the value for x is obtained by interpolating between the values specified for the key times. The result in this case is that the rectangle moves from left to right during the first half of the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr> and then back from right to left in the second half.</p>
<p>Transforms can also be animated, but you need to use the <code>&lt;animateTransform&gt;</code> tag instead of <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code>, and you need to add a <em>type</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> to specify which transform you are animating, such as "rotate" or "translate".

<p>Many <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attributes</abbr> of a shape element can be animated by adding an <animate> element to the content of the shape element.

<span class="nt">&lt;/rect&gt;</span>

<p>Note that the <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code> is nested inside the <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code>. The <em>attributeName</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object.

<p>What if we want the rectangle to move back and forth between its initial and final position? For that, we need something called <strong>keyframe <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr></strong>, which is an important idea in its own right.

In a keyframe <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change.

Here is our moving rectangle example, modified to use keyframes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;rect</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">x=</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">y=</span><span class="s">&quot;210&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;40&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;40&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;animate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">attributeName=</span><span class="s">&quot;x&quot;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/rect&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <em>keyTimes</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> is a list of numbers, separated by semicolons. The numbers are in the range 0 to 1, and should be in increasing order. The first number should be 0 and the last number should be 1. A number specifies a time during the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, as a fraction of the complete <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>. For example, 0.5 is a point half-way through the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, and 0.75 is three-quarters of the way. The <em>values</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> is a list of values, with one value for each key time. In this case, the value for x is 0 at the start of the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, 430 half-way through the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>, and 0 again at the end of the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr>. Between the key times, the value for x is obtained by interpolating between the values specified for the key times. The result in this case is that the rectangle moves from left to right during the first half of the <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr> and then back from right to left in the second half.</p>
<p>Transforms can also be animated, but you need to use the <code>&lt;animateTransform&gt;</code> tag instead of <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code>, and you need to add a <em>type</em> <abbr title="A property, such as color, of a graphical object. An image can be specified by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.">attribute</abbr> to specify which transform you are animating, such as "rotate" or "translate". Here, for example, is a transform <abbr title="A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other, will produce the impression of continuous motion or change. The term animation also refers to the process of creating such image sequences.">animation</abbr> applied to a group:</p>
