<p>In the rest of this chapter, we look at specific implementations of two-dimensional graphics. There are a few new ideas here, but mostly you will see how the general concepts that we have covered are used in several real graphics systems.</p>
<p>In this section, our focus is on the Java programming language. Java remains one of the most popular programming languages. Its standard desktop version includes a sophisticated 2D graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr>, which is our topic here. Before reading this section, you should already know the basics of Java programming. But even if you don't, you should be able to follow most of the discussion of the graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> itself. (See <a href="../a1/s1.md">Section A.1</a> in <a href="../../a1/">Appendix A</a> for a very basic introduction to Java.)</p>
<p>The graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> that is discussed here is part of Swing, an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> for graphical user interface programming that is included as part of the standard distribution of Java. Many Java programs are now written using an alternative <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> called JavaFX, which is not part of the standard distribution.

Because of nesting of elements, the document can be represented by a tree-like data structure.">HTML</abbr> canvas graphics, which is discussed in <a href="../s6/">Section 2.6</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of Java had a much smaller graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr>. It was tightly focused on <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr>, and it used only integer coordinates. The <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> had subroutines for stroking and filling a variety of basic shapes, including lines, rectangles, ovals, and polygons (although Java uses the term draw instead of stroke). Its specification of the meaning of drawing operations was very precise on the <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> level. Integer coordinates are defined to refer to the lines between <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr>. For example, a 12-by-8 <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> grid has x-coordinates from 0 to 12 and y-coordinates from 0 to 8, as shown below. The lines between <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> are numbered, not the <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels.

<p>The command <em>fillRect(3,2,5,3)</em> fills the rectangle with upper left corner at (3,2), with width 5, and with height 3, as shown on the left above. The command <em>drawRect(3,2,5,3)</em> conceptually drags a "pen" around the outline of this rectangle. However, the pen is a 1-<abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> square, and it is the upper left corner of the pen that moves along the outline.

To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> below the edge are colored. The result is as shown on the right above. My point here is not to belabor the details, but to point out that having a precise specification of the meaning of graphical operations gives you very fine control over what happens on the <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> level.</p>
<p>Java's original graphics did not support things like real-number coordinates, transforms, <abbr title="A technique used to reduce the jagged or &quot;staircase&quot; appearance of diagonal lines, text, and other shapes that are drawn using pixels. When a pixel is only partly covered by a geometric shape, then the color of the pixel is a blend of the color of the shape and the color of the background, with the degree of blending depending on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the geometric shape.">antialiasing</abbr>, or gradients.

<p>Java is an object-oriented language. Its <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> is defined as a large set of classes, The actual drawing operations in the original graphics <abbr title="Application Programming Interface.

An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> were mostly contained in the class named <ins class="critic">Graphics</ins>. In the newer Swing <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr>, drawing operations are methods in a class named <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins>, which is a subclass of <ins class="critic">Graphics</ins>, so that all the original drawing operations are still available. (A class in Java is contained in a collection of classes known as a "package." <ins class="critic">Graphics</ins> and <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins>, for example, are in the package named java.awt. Classes that define shapes and transforms are in a package named java.awt.geom.)</p>
<p>A graphics system needs a place to draw. In Java, the drawing surface is often an object of the class <ins class="critic">JPanel</ins>, which represents a rectangular area on the screen. The <ins class="critic">JPanel</ins> class has a method named <em>paintComponent()</em> to draw its content. To create a drawing surface, you can create a subclass of <ins class="critic">JPanel</ins> and provide a definition for its <em>paintComponent()</em> method. All drawing should be done inside <em>paintComponent()</em>; when it is necessary to change the contents of the drawing, you can call the panel's repaint() method to trigger a call to <em>paintComponent()</em>. The <em>paintComponent()</em> method has a parameter of type <ins class="critic">Graphics</ins>, but the parameter that is passed to the method is actually an object of type <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins>, and it can be type-cast to <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins> to obtain access to the more advanced graphics capabilities. So, the definition of the <em>paintComponent()</em> method usually looks something like this:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>In the rest of this section, I will assume that g2 is a variable of type <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins>, and I will discuss some of the things that you can do with it. As a first example, I note that <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins> supports <abbr title="A technique used to reduce the jagged or &quot;staircase&quot; appearance of diagonal lines, text, and other shapes that are drawn using pixels. When a pixel is only partly covered by a geometric shape, then the color of the pixel is a blend of the color of the shape and the color of the background, with the degree of blending depending on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the geometric shape.">antialiasing</abbr>, but it is not turned on by default. It can be enabled in a graphics context g2 with the rather intimidating command</p>

<p>For simple examples of graphics in complete Java programs, you can look at the sample programs <a href="../../../en/source/java2d/GraphicsStarter.java">java2d/GraphicsStarter.java</a> and <a href="../../../en/source/java2d/AnimationStarter.java">java2d/AnimationStarter.java</a>. They provide very minimal frameworks for drawing static and animated images, respectively, using <ins class="critic">Graphics2D</ins>. The program <a href="../../../en/source/java2d/EventsStarter.java">java2d/EventsStarter.java</a> is a similar framework for working with mouse and key events in a graphics program. You can use these programs as the basis for some experimentation if you want to explore Java graphics.</p>

<p>Drawing with the original <strong>Graphics</strong> class is done using integer coordinates, with the measurement given in <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr>. This works well in the standard <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>, but is not appropriate when real-number coordinates are used, since the unit of measure in such a <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> will not be equal to a <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr>. We need to be able to specify shapes using real numbers. The Java package java.awt.geom provides support for shapes defined using real number coordinates. For example, the class <strong>Line2D</strong> in that package represents line segments whose endpoints are given as pairs of real numbers.</p>
<p>Now, Java has two real number types: <strong>double</strong> and <strong>float</strong>. The <strong>double</strong> type can represent a larger range of numbers than <strong>float</strong>, with a greater number of significant digits, and <strong>double</strong> is the more commonly used type. In fact, <strong>doubles</strong> are simply easier to use in Java. However, <strong>float</strong> values generally have enough accuracy for graphics applications, and they have the advantage of taking up less space in memory. Furthermore, computer graphics hardware often uses float values internally.</p>
<p>So, given these considerations, the <em>java.awt.geom</em> package actually provides two versions of each shape, one using coordinates of type <strong>float</strong> and one using coordinates of type <strong>double</strong>. This is done in a rather strange way. Taking Line2D as an example, the class Line2D itself is an <abbr title="In object-oriented programming, a class that is meant to be used only as a basis for subclasses. Objects can be created from the subclasses, but not from the abstract class itself. The purpose of an abstract class is to define the properties and behaviors that all of its subclasses have in common.">abstract class</abbr>. It has two subclasses, one that represents lines using float coordinates and one using double coordinates. The strangest part is that these subclasses are defined as nested classes inside <em>Line2D: Line2D.Float</em> and <em>Line2D.Double</em>. This means that you can declare a variable of type Line2D, but to create an object, you need to use <em>Line2D.Double</em> or <em>Line2D.Float</em>:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that when using constants of type <strong>float</strong> in Java, you have to add "F" as a suffix to the value. This is one reason why <strong>doubles</strong> are easier in Java. For simplicity, you might want to stick to using <em>Line2D.Double</em>. However, <em>Line2D.Float</em> might give slightly better performance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's take a look at some of the other classes from <em>java.awt.geom</em>. The <abbr title="In object-oriented programming, a class that is meant to be used only as a basis for subclasses. Objects can be created from the subclasses, but not from the abstract class itself. The purpose of an abstract class is to define the properties and behaviors that all of its subclasses have in common.">abstract class</abbr> <strong>Point2D</strong>—with its concrete subclasses <strong>Point2D.Double</strong> and <strong>Point2D.Float</strong>—represents a point in two dimensions, specified by two real number coordinates. A point is not a shape; you can't fill or stroke it. A point can be constructed from two real numbers ("new Point2D.Double(1.2,3.7)"). If p is a variable of type Point2D, you can use p.getX() and p.getY() to retrieve its coordinates, and you can use p.setX(x), p.setY(y), or p.setLocation(x,y) to set its coordinates. If pd is a variable of type Point2D.Double, you can also refer directly to the coordinates as pd.x and pd.y (and similarly for Point2D.Float). Other classes in <em>java.awt.geom</em> offer a similar variety of ways to manipulate their properties, and I won't try to list them all here.</p>
<p>There is a variety of classes that represent geometric shapes, including Line2D, Rectangle2D, RoundRectangle2D, Ellipse2D, Arc2D, and Path2D. All of these are abstract classes, and each of them contains a pair of subclasses such as Rectangle2D.Double and Rectangle2D.Float. Some shapes, such as rectangles, have interiors that can be filled; such shapes also have outlines that can be stroked. Some shapes, such as lines, are purely one-dimensional and can only be stroked.</p>
<p>Aside from lines, rectangles are probably the simplest shapes. A <strong>Rectangle2D</strong> has a corner point (x,y), a width, and a height, and can be constructed from that data ("new Rectangle2D.Double(x,y,w,h)"). The corner point (x,y) specifies the minimum x- and y-values in the rectangle. For the usual <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>, (x,y) is the upper left corner. However, in a <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr> in which the minimum value of y is at the bottom, (x,y) would be the lower left corner. The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. A variable r of type <strong>Rectangle2D.Double</strong> has public instance variables r.x, r.y, r.width, and r.height. If the width or the height is less than or equal to zero, nothing will be drawn when the rectangle is filled or stroked. A common task is to define a rectangle from two corner points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). This can be accomplished by creating a rectangle with height and width equal to zero and then adding the second point to the rectangle. Adding a point to a rectangle causes the rectangle to grow just enough to include that point:</p>

<p>The classes <strong>Line2D</strong>, <strong>Ellipse2D</strong>, <strong>RoundRectangle2D</strong> and <strong>Arc2D</strong> create other basic shapes and work similarly to <strong>Rectangle2D</strong>. You can check the Java <abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr> documentation for details.</p>
<p>The <strong>Path2D</strong> class is more interesting. It represents general paths made up of segments that can be lines and Bezier curves. Paths are created using methods similar to the moveTo and lineTo subroutines that were discussed in <a href="../s2/#223--多边形曲线和路径">Subsection 2.2.3</a>. To create a path, you start by constructing an object of type <strong>Path2D.Double</strong> (or <strong>Path2D.Float</strong>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">Path2D</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">Double</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Path2D</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">Double</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The path p is empty when it is first created. You construct the path by moving an imaginary "pen" along the path that you want to create. The method p.moveTo(x,y) moves the pen to the point (x,y) without drawing anything. It is used to specify the initial point of the path or the starting point of a new piece of the path. The method p.lineTo(x,y) draws a line from the current pen position to (x,y), leaving the pen at (x,y). The method p.close() can be used to close the path (or the current piece of the path) by drawing a line back to its starting point. For example, the following code creates a triangle with vertices at (0,5), (2,-3), and (-4,1):</p>

<p>Finally, I will note that it is possible to draw a copy of an image into a graphics context. The image could be loaded from a file or created by the program. I discuss the second possibility later in this section. An image is represented by an object of type <strong>Image</strong>. In fact, I will assume here that the object is of type <strong>BufferedImage</strong>, which is a subclass of <strong>Image</strong>. If img is such an object, then</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">g2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">drawImage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>will draw the image with its upper left corner at the point (x,y). (The fourth parameter is hard to explain, but it should be specified as null for <strong>BufferedImages</strong>.) This draws the image at its natural width and height, but a different width and height can be specified in the method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">g2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">drawImage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">width</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">height</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also a method for drawing a string of text. The method specifies the string and the basepoint of the string. (The basepoint is the lower left corner of the string, ignoring "descenders" like the tail on the letter "g".) For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">g2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">drawString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>Images and strings are subject to transforms in the same way as other shapes. Transforms are the only way to get rotated text and images.

<p>Beyond solid colors, Java has the class <strong>GradientPaint</strong>, to represent simple linear gradients, and TexturePaint to represent pattern fills. (Image patterns used in a similar way in 3D graphics are called textures.) Gradients and patterns were discussed in <a href="../s2/#222--描边和填充">Subsection 2.2.2</a>. For these paints, the color that is applied to a <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels.

<p>To create a <strong>TexturePaint</strong>, you need a <strong>BufferedImage</strong> object to specify the image that it will use as a pattern. You also have to say how coordinates in the image will map to drawing coordinates in the display. You do this by specifying a rectangle that will hold one copy of the image. So the <abbr title="In object-oriented programming, a subroutine that is used to create objects.

<p>Java implements geometric transformations as methods in the <strong>Graphics2D</strong> class. For example, if g2 is a <strong>Graphics2D</strong>, then calling g2.translate(1,3) will apply a <abbr title="A geometric transform that adds a given translation amount to each coordinate of a point. Translation is used to move objects without changing their size or orientation.">translation</abbr> by (1,3) to objects that are drawn after the method is called. The methods that are available correspond to the transform functions discussed in <a href="../s3/">Section 2.3</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>g2.scale(sx,sy)</code> — scales by a horizontal scale factor sx and a vertical scale factor sy.</li>
<li><code>g2.rotate(r)</code> — rotates by the angle r about the origin, where the angle is measured in radians. A positive angle rotates the positive x-axis in the direction of the positive y-axis.</li>
<li><code>g2.rotate(r,x,y)</code> — rotates by the angle r about the point (x,y).</li>
<li><code>g2.translate(dx,dy)</code> — translates by dx horizontally and dy vertically.</li>
<li><code>g2.shear(sx,sy)</code> — applies a horizontal shear amount sx and a vertical shear amount sy. (Usually, one of the shear amounts is 0, giving a pure horizontal or vertical shear.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A transform in Java is represented as an object of the class <strong>AffineTransform</strong>. You can create a general <abbr title="A transform that preserves parallel lines. That is, when the transform is applied to a pair of lines that are parallel, then the resulting transformed lines are also parallel. An affine transform, T, has the property that the transform of the line segment between a point (x1,y1) and a point (x2,y2) is the line between the points T(x1,y1) and T(x2,y2).

<p>You can apply the transform trns to a graphics context g2 by calling g2.transform(trns).</p>
<p>The graphics context g2 includes the current <abbr title="A transform that preserves parallel lines.

Commands such as g2.rotate and g2.transform modify the current transform. You can get a copy of the current transform by calling g2.getTransform(), which returns an <strong>AffineTransform</strong> object. You can set the current transform using g2.setTransform(trns). This replaces the current transform in g2 with the <strong>AffineTransform</strong> trns. (Note that g2.setTransform(trns) is different from g2.transform(trns); the first command <strong>replaces</strong> the current transform in g2, while the second <strong>modifies</strong> the current transform by composing it with trns.)</p>
<p>The getTransform and setTransform methods can be used to implement <abbr title="Creating complex geometric models in a hierarchical fashion, starting with geometric primitives, combining them into components that can then be further combined into more complex components, and so on.">hierarchical modeling</abbr>. The idea, as discussed in <a href="../s4/">Section 2.4</a>, is that before drawing an object, you should save the current transform. After drawing the object, restore the saved transform.

<p>In addition to modeling transformations, transforms are used to set up the window-to-<abbr title="The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed.

See the sample program <a href="../../../en/source/java2d/GraphicsStarter.java">java2d/GraphicsStarter.java</a> for an example.</p>
<hr />
<p>I will mention one more use for <strong>AffineTransform</strong> objects: Sometimes, you do need to explicitly transform coordinates. For example, given <abbr title="The coordinate system in which the coordinates for points in an object are originally specified, before they are transformed by any modeling or other transform that will be applied to the object.">object coordinates</abbr> (x,y), I might need to know where they will actually end up on the screen, in <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels.

The AffineTransform class has a method for applying the <abbr title="A transform that preserves parallel lines. That is, when the transform is applied to a pair of lines that are parallel, then the resulting transformed lines are also parallel. An affine transform, T, has the property that the transform of the line segment between a point (x1,y1) and a point (x2,y2) is the line between the points T(x1,y1) and T(x2,y2). Effectively, the transform of a line segment can be computed just by transforming its two endpoints. This makes affine transforms very efficient for computer graphics.

<p>One way I have used this is when working with strings. Often when displaying a string in a transformed <abbr title="A way of assigning numerical coordinates to geometric points. In two dimensions, each point corresponds to a pair of numbers. In three dimensions, each point corresponds to a triple of numbers.">coordinate system</abbr>, I want to transform the basepoint of a string, but not the string itself. That is, I want the transformation to affect the location of the string but not its size or <abbr title="A geometric transform that rotates each point by a specified angle about some point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).">rotation</abbr>. To accomplish this, I use the above technique to obtain the <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> coordinates for the transformed basepoint, and then draw the string at those coordinates, using an original, untransformed graphics context.</p>
<p>The reverse operation is also sometimes necessary. That is, given <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> coordinates (px,py), find the point (x,y) that is transformed to (px,py) by a given <abbr title="A transform that preserves parallel lines.

Effectively, the transform of a line segment can be computed just by transforming its two endpoints. This makes affine transforms very efficient for computer graphics. Any affine transform can be represented as a composition of rotations, translations, and scalings.">affine transform</abbr>. For example, when implementing mouse interaction, you will generally know the <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels.

<p>There are also methods for reading and setting the colors of an entire rectangular region of <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr>.</p>
<p>Pixel operations are used to implement two features of the sample program. First, there is a "Smudge" tool. When the user drags with this tool, it's like smearing wet paint. When the user first clicks the mouse, the color components from a small square of <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> surrounding the mouse position are copied into arrays. As the user moves the mouse, color from the arrays is blended into the color of the <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> near the mouse position, while those colors are blended into the colors in the arrays. Here is a small rectangle that has been "smudged":</p>

</figure></p>
<p>The second use of <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> manipulation is in implementing "filters." A filter, in this program, is an operation that modifies an image by replacing the color of each <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> with a weighted average of the colors of a 3-by-3 square of <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr>. A "Blur" filter for example, uses equal weights for all <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixels</abbr> in the average, so the color of a <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> is changed to the simple average of the colors of that <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> and its neighbors. Using different weights for each <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> can produce some striking effects.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="A digital image is made up of rows and columns of small rectangles called pixels. To specify a digital image, a color is assigned to each pixel in the image.">pixel</abbr> manipulation in the sample program produces effects that can't be achieved with pure <abbr title="An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers. Vectors in that sense are often used to represent points in 2D, 3D, or 4D space. Properly, however, a vector represents a quantity that has a length and a direction; a vector used in this way can be visualized as an arrow.">vector</abbr> graphics. I encourage you to learn more by looking at the <a href="../../../en/source/java2d/JavaPixelManipulation.java">source code</a>. You might also take a look at the live demos in the <a href="../s6/">next section</a>, which implement the same effects using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language.
