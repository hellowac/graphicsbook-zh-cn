<p>我们将以OpenGL作为3D图形编程的主要基础。最初的<strong><abbr title="计算机图形API系列，实现在许多图形硬件设备中。API有多个版本，并且有多种不同编程语言的实现或“绑定”。用于移动设备（如手机）的OpenGL版本称为OpenGL ES。WebGL是用于网页的版本。OpenGL可用于2D和3D图形，但通常与3D图形关联更多。">开放GL</abbr>(<abbr title="A family of computer graphics APIs that is implemented in many graphics hardware devices.

WebGL is based on OpenGL ES, the version of OpenGL for embedded systems, with a few changes to adapt it to the JavaScript language and the Web environment.">WebGL</abbr>)</strong>的形式，它是Web上大多数3D图形的使用方式。本节将为您介绍一些关于OpenGL历史和支持它的图形硬件的背景知识。</p>
<p>在最初的台式计算机中，屏幕内容是由<strong><abbr title="计算机中的中央处理单元，实际执行程序的组件。CPU从计算机的内存中读取机器语言指令并执行它们。">中央处理器</abbr>(<abbr title="The Central Processing Unit in a computer, the component that actually executes programs. The CPU reads machine language instructions from the computer's memory and carries them out.">CPU</abbr>)</strong>直接管理的。例如，要在屏幕上绘制一条线段，CPU将运行一个循环来设置沿线的每个像素的颜色。不用说，图形可能会占用CPU大量的时间。与我们今天期望的相比，图形性能非常慢。那么，有什么变化呢？当然，计算机总体上更快了，但最大的变化是在现代计算机中，图形处理是由一种称为<strong><abbr title="图形处理单元(Graphics Processing Unit), 执行创建和操作图像的图形计算的计算机硬件组件。诸如在屏幕上绘制直线或渲染3D图像之类的操作是在GPU中完成的，该组件被优化以非常快速地执行此类操作。">图形处理器</abbr>(<abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit, a computer hardware component that performs graphical computations that create and manipulate images. Operations such as drawing a line on the screen or rendering a 3D image are done in the GPU, which is optimized to perform such operations very quickly.">GPU</abbr>)</strong>的专用组件完成的。 GPU包括用于执行图形计算的处理器； 实际上，它可以包含大量的这种处理器，这些处理器并行工作以大大加速图形操作。 它还包括专用内存，用于存储诸如图像和坐标列表之类的东西。 GPU处理器对存储在GPU内存中的数据具有非常快的访问速度——比它们访问存储在计算机主内存中的数据要快得多。</p>
<p>要绘制一条线或执行其他图形操作，CPU只需将命令以及任何必要的数据发送到GPU，GPU负责实际执行这些命令。 CPU将大部分图形工作交给了GPU，后者被优化为非常快地执行这项工作。 GPU理解的命令集组成了GPU的<strong><abbr title="应用程序编程接口。用于执行某项任务的相关类、函数、常量等的集合。API是一个“接口”，可以在不了解其功能实际实现方式的情况下使用它。">接口</abbr>(<abbr title="Application Programming Interface. A collection of related classes, functions, constants, etc., for performing some task. An API is an &quot;interface&quot; in the sense that it can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.">API</abbr>)</strong>。 OpenGL是图形API的一个例子，大多数GPU支持OpenGL，意味着它们可以理解OpenGL命令，或者至少OpenGL命令可以被有效地转换为GPU可以理解的命令。</p>
<p>OpenGL并不是唯一的图形API。 实际上，它正在被更现代的替代方案所取代，包括<strong><abbr title="用于3D图形和计算的开源跨平台API，设计为OpenGL的更现代和高效的替代品。">伏尔甘</abbr>(<abbr title="An open-source cross-platform API for 3D graphics and computation, designed as a more modern and efficient replacement for OpenGL.">Vulkan</abbr>)</strong>，这是由负责OpenGL的同一组织开发的开放API。 还有一些由苹果和微软使用的专有API：<strong><abbr title="苹果的专有API，用于MacOS计算机和iOS设备上的3D图形和计算。">metal</abbr>(<abbr title="Apple's proprietary API for 3D graphics and computation on MacOS computers and iOS devices.">Metal</abbr>)</strong>和<strong><abbr title="微软的专有API，用于Windows操作系统上的3D图形。">direct3D</abbr>(<abbr title="Microsoft's proprietary API for 3D graphics on the Windows operating system.">Direct3D</abbr>)</strong>。 至于Web，一个名为<strong><abbr title="一种新的JavaScript图形API，类似于WebGL，但旨在让Web程序访问现代GPU功能，如计算着色器。">网页GPU</abbr>(<abbr title="A new JavaScript graphics API, similar to WebGL, but designed to let web programs access modern GPU capabilities such as compute shaders.">WebGPU</abbr>)</strong>的新API已经开发了一段时间，并且已经在一些Web浏览器中实现了。 这些较新的API是复杂且底层的。 它们更多地设计用于速度和效率，而不是易用性。 本教材不涵盖Metal、Direct3D和Vulkan，但在<a href="../../c9/">第9章</a>中介绍了WebGPU。 在大部分的内容中，我们将使用OpenGL，因为它提供了一个更容易入门的3D图形介绍，以及WebGL，因为它仍然是Web浏览器中3D图形的主要API。</p>

<p>In the first desktop computers, the contents of the screen were managed directly by the <abbr title="The Central Processing Unit in a computer, the component that actually executes programs. The CPU reads machine language instructions from the computer's memory and carries them out.">CPU</abbr>. For example, to draw a line segment on the screen, the <abbr title="The Central Processing Unit in a computer, the component that actually executes programs.

Needless to say, graphics could take up a lot of the <abbr title="The Central Processing Unit in a computer, the component that actually executes programs. The CPU reads machine language instructions from the computer's memory and carries them out.">CPU</abbr>'s time. And graphics performance was very slow, compared to what we expect today. So what has changed? Computers are much faster in general, of course, but the big change is that in modern computers, graphics processing is done by a specialized component called a <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit, a computer hardware component that performs graphical computations that create and manipulate images.

<p>我曾经说过OpenGL是一个API，但实际上它是一系列API，经过多次扩展和修订。在2023年，当前（也许是最终）版本是4.6，它首次发布于2017年。这与1992年的1.0版本有很大的不同。此外，还有一个专门的版本叫做OpenGL ES，用于诸如手机和平板电脑之类的“嵌入式系统”。还有WebGL，用于Web浏览器，基本上是OpenGL ES的一个移植版本。了解OpenGL的变化是如何发生以及原因将会很有用。</p>
<p>首先，您应该知道OpenGL被设计为一个“客户端/服务器”系统。服务器负责控制计算机的显示并执行图形计算，执行客户端发出的命令。通常，服务器是一个GPU，包括其图形处理器和内存。服务器执行OpenGL命令。客户端是同一台计算机中的CPU，以及它正在运行的应用程序。OpenGL命令来自于在CPU上运行的程序。但是，实际上可以通过网络远程运行OpenGL程序。也就是说，您可以在远程计算机（OpenGL客户端）上执行应用程序，而图形计算和显示是在您实际使用的计算机上完成的（OpenGL服务器）。</p>
<p>关键思想是客户端和服务器是分开的组件，并且在这些组件之间有一个通信通道。OpenGL命令及其所需的数据通过该通道从客户端（<abbr title="The Central Processing Unit in a computer, the component that actually executes programs. The CPU reads machine language instructions from the computer's memory and carries them out.">CPU</abbr>）传输到服务器（<abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit, a computer hardware component that performs graphical computations that create and manipulate images. Operations such as drawing a line on the screen or rendering a 3D image are done in the GPU, which is optimized to perform such operations very quickly.">GPU</abbr>）。通道的容量可能是图形性能的限制因素。想象一下将图像绘制到屏幕上。如果GPU可以在微秒内绘制图像，但是将图像数据从CPU发送到GPU需要毫秒级的时间，那么GPU的快速速度就无关紧要了——绘制图像所需的大部分时间是通信时间。</p>
<p>因此，OpenGL发展的驱动因素之一是希望限制CPU和GPU之间需要的通信量。一种方法是将信息存储在GPU的内存中。如果某些数据将被多次使用，则可以一次将其传输到GPU并存储在那里的内存中，从而立即使GPU可以访问。另一种方法是尝试减少必须传输到GPU以绘制给定图像的OpenGL命令的数量。</p>
<p>OpenGL绘制诸如三角形之类的<strong>基元</strong>。指定一个基元意味着为每个顶点指定<strong><abbr title="一种将数值坐标分配给几何点的方法。在二维中，每个点对应一对数字。在三维中，每个点对应一组三个数字。">坐标</abbr></strong>和<strong><abbr title="图形对象的属性，例如颜色。图像可以通过其包含的几何形状以及它们的属性来指定。">属性</abbr></strong>。在最初的OpenGL 1.0中，使用单独的命令来指定每个顶点的坐标，并且每当属性的值发生变化时都需要一个命令。要绘制一个三角形将需要三个或更多个命令。由成千上万个三角形组成的复杂对象的绘制将需要许多成千上万个命令。即使在OpenGL 1.1中，也可以使用单个命令而不是数千个来绘制这样的对象。对象的所有数据将加载到数组中，然后可以一次性将其发送到GPU。不幸的是，如果要多次绘制对象，则每次绘制对象时都必须重新传输数据。这在OpenGL 1.5中通过<strong><abbr title="顶点缓冲对象。可以容纳一组顶点的坐标或其他属性的内存块。VBO 可以存储在 GPU 上。VBO 使得可以将此类数据发送到 GPU 一次，然后多次重用。在 OpenGL 中，VBO 与函数 glDrawArrays 和 glDrawElements 一起使用。">顶点缓冲对象</abbr>(<abbr title="Vertex Buffer Object.

<p>First of all, you should know that <abbr title="A family of computer graphics APIs that is implemented in many graphics hardware devices.

<p>The key idea is that the client and the server are separate components, and there is a communication channel between those components. <abbr title="A family of computer graphics APIs that is implemented in many graphics hardware devices.

Operations such as drawing a line on the screen or rendering a 3D image are done in the GPU, which is optimized to perform such operations very quickly.">GPU</abbr>) over that channel. The capacity of the channel can be a limiting factor in graphics performance. Think of drawing an image onto the screen.

<p>作为对GPU硬件的最后一点说明，我应该指出，对于不同顶点进行的计算基本上是相互独立的，因此大概可以并行进行计算。对于不同片段的计算也是如此。事实上，GPU可以拥有数百个甚至数千个可以并行操作的处理器。诚然，单个处理器的性能远不及CPU强大，但典型的每个顶点和每个片段的计算并不是非常复杂的。在图形计算中可能存在的大量处理器和大量并行性，使得即使在相当廉价的GPU上也能实现令人印象深刻的图形性能。</p>
