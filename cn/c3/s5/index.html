<p>一个向量是具有长度和方向的量。一个向量可以被视为一个箭头，只要你记得重要的是箭头的长度和方向，而其具体位置是无关紧要的。在计算机图形学中，向量经常被用来表示方向，比如从一个物体到光源的方向，或者表面朝向的方向。在这些情况下，我们更关心向量的方向而不是它的长度。</p>
<p>如果我们将一个三维向量V可视化为从原点(0,0,0)开始的箭头，结束于一个点P，那么我们可以在一定程度上将V与P等同起来——至少只要我们记得从任何其他点开始的箭头也可以用来表示V。如果P的坐标是(a,b,c)，我们可以使用相同的坐标来表示V。当我们将(a,b,c)视为一个向量时，a的值表示箭头起点到终点之间的x坐标的变化，b是y坐标的变化，c是z坐标的变化。例如，3D点(x,y,z) = (3,4,5)具有与向量(dx,dy,dz) = (3,4,5)相同的坐标。对于点来说，<abbr title="一种将数值坐标分配给几何点的方法。在二维中，每个点对应一对数字。在三维中，每个点对应一组三个数字。">坐标</abbr>(3,4,5)指定了空间中的一个位置在xyz坐标系中。对于向量来说，<abbr title="一种将数值坐标分配给几何点的方法。在二维中，每个点对应一对数字。在三维中，每个点对应一组三个数字。">坐标</abbr>(3,4,5)指定了沿着该向量的x、y和z坐标的变化。如果我们用一个从原点(0,0,0)开始的箭头来表示向量，那么箭头的头部将在点(3,4,5)处。但我们也可以将向量视为一个从点(1,1,1)开始的箭头，这种情况下箭头的头部将在点(4,5,6)处。</p>
<p>点与向量之间的区别是微妙的。对于某些目的，可以忽略这种区别；对于其他目的，它是重要的。通常，我们只有一系列数字，我们可以把它们看作是一个向量或一个点的坐标，取决于上下文中哪个更合适。</p>
<p>一个向量的基本性质之一是它的长度。用它的坐标来表达，一个三维向量(x,y,z)的长度由<code>sqrt(x2+y2+z2)</code>给出。（这只是三维空间中的毕达哥拉斯定理。）如果v是一个向量，它的长度用|v|表示。一个向量的长度也称为它的<strong><abbr title="向量长度的另一种术语。对于由 (x,y,z) 给出的三维向量，范数是 x*x+y*y+z*z 的平方根。">范数</abbr></strong>。（在这里我们考虑的是三维向量，但是其他维度的概念和公式类似。）</p>
<p>长度为1的向量尤其重要。它们被称为<strong><abbr title="长度为一的向量。">单位向量</abbr></strong>。如果v = (x,y,z)是任意一个不是(0,0,0)的向量，那么就有一个与v指向相同方向的单位向量。该向量由下式给出：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>其中 <em>length</em> 是v的长度。将一个向量除以它的长度被称为<strong>归一化</strong>该向量：结果是一个与原始向量指向相同方向的单位向量。</p>
<p>两个向量可以相加。给定两个向量 <code>v1 = (x1,y1,z1)</code> 和 <code>v2 = (x2,y2,z2)</code>，它们的和定义为</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">v1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">x2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y1</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">y2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z1</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">z2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>该和有一个几何意义：</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../../../en/c3/vector-sum.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="123" src="../../../en/c3/vector-sum.png" /></a></p>
<p>乘法更加复杂。类似于和的定义，两个向量的乘积的明显定义没有几何意义，并且很少被使用。然而，有三种向量乘法被使用：<abbr title="数字和向量的乘积。数字 s 和向量 v 的标量积是通过将 v 的每个坐标乘以 s 而获得的向量。在三维空间中，如果 s 是一个数字，v=(x,y,z)，那么 s 乘以 v 的标量积是向量 (sx,sy,sz)。">标量乘积</abbr>，点积和叉积。</p>
<p>如果 <code>v = (x,y,z)</code> 是一个向量，a是一个数，则a和v的<strong><abbr title="数字和向量的乘积。数字 s 和向量 v 的标量积是通过将 v 的每个坐标乘以 s 而获得的向量。在三维空间中，如果 s 是一个数字，v=(x,y,z)，那么 s 乘以 v 的标量积是向量 (sx,sy,sz)。">标量乘积</abbr></strong>定义为</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">av</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>假设a是正数且v不为零，那么av是一个指向与v相同方向的向量，其长度是v的长度乘以a。如果a是负数，则av指向与v相反的方向，并且其长度是|a|乘以v的长度。这种类型的乘积被称为标量乘积，因为像a这样的数字也被称为“标量”，可能是因为乘以a将v缩放到一个新的长度。</p>
<p>给定两个向量 <code>v1 = (x1,y1,z1)</code> 和 <code>v2 = (x2,y2,z2)</code>，v1 和 v2 的<strong><abbr title="两个向量的点积是对应坐标的乘积之和。对于三维向量 v=(x,y,z) 和 w=(a,b,c)，v 和 w 的点积是 x*a+y*b+z*c。点积等于两个向量之间的夹角的余弦，除以它们的长度的乘积。">点积</abbr></strong>由 v1·v2 表示，并由以下方式定义：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">v1</span><span class="err">·</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">z2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>注意，点积是一个数，而不是一个向量。点积有几个非常重要的几何意义。首先，注意向量 v 的长度就是 v·v 的平方根。此外，两个非零向量 v1 和 v2 的点积具有以下性质：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">cos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">角度</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="err">·</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="o">|*|</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>其中角度是 v1 和 v2 之间的角度的度量。特别地，在两个长度为 1 的单位向量的情况下，它们的点积简单地是它们之间的夹角的余弦。此外，由于 90 度角的余弦是零，如果两个非零向量的点积为零，则它们垂直。由于这些性质，点积在光照计算中特别重要，其中光照对表面的影响取决于光线与表面的夹角。</p>
<p>标量乘积和点积在任何维度中都有定义。对于三维向量，还有另一种称为<strong><abbr title="两个三维向量的向量积。向量 v 和 w 的叉积是一个垂直于 v 和 w 的向量，并且其长度等于 v 和 w 之间的夹角的正弦的绝对值。如果 v=(x,y,z) 和 w=(a,b,c)，那么它们的叉积是向量 (yc-zb,za-xc,xb-ya)。">叉积</abbr></strong>的乘积类型，它也具有重要的几何意义。对于向量 <code>v1 = (x1,y1,z1)</code> 和 <code>v2 = (x2,y2,z2)</code>，v1 和 v2 的叉积记为 v1×v2，并由以下向量定义：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">v1</span><span class="err">×</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">z2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">z2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y1</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>如果 <em>v1</em> 和 <em>v2</em> 是非零向量，则当且仅当 v1 和 v2 指向相同方向或完全相反方向时，v1×v2 为零。假设 v1×v2 是非零的，那么它同时垂直于 v1 和 v2；此外，<abbr title="向量空间中的元素。向量空间的元素可以相加，并且可以乘以常数。对于计算机图形，向量只是包含两个、三个或四个数字的列表或数组。在这个意义上，向量通常用于表示2D、3D或4D空间中的点。然而，准确地说，向量表示具有长度和方向的数量；以这种方式使用的向量可以被可视化为箭头。">向量</abbr> v1、v2 和 v1×v2 符合右手法则（在右手坐标系中）；也就是说，如果你用右手的手指从 v1 卷曲到 v2，那么你的拇指指向 v1×v2 的方向。如果 v1 和 v2 是垂直单位向量，那么叉积 v1×v2 也是一个单位向量，它同时垂直于 v1 和 v2。</p>
<p>最后，我要指出，给定两个点 <code>P1 = (x1,y1,z1)</code> 和 <code>P2 = (x2,y2,z2)</code>，它们的差 P2−P1 可以由以下方式定义：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">P2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">−</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">P1</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">−</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">−</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">−</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">z1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>这个差是一个向量，可以将其视为一条从 P1 开始、指向 P2 结束的箭头。</p>
<p>现在，假设 P1、P2 和 P3 是多边形的顶点。那么向量 P1−P2 和 P3−P2 位于多边形的平面内，因此叉积</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">P3</span><span class="err">−</span><span class="n">P2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">×</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">P1</span><span class="err">−</span><span class="n">P2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>是一个垂直于多边形的向量。</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../../../en/c3/cross-product.png" data-type="image" data-width="100%" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="123" src="../../../en/c3/cross-product.png" /></a></p>
<p>这个向量被称为多边形的<strong><abbr title="在曲面上的一个点处，法向量是垂直于该点处曲面的向量。曲线的法向量类似定义。法向量对于光照计算非常重要。">法向量</abbr></strong>。长度为一的法向量称为<strong><abbr title="长度为一的法向量；即，在曲线或曲面上的给定点处垂直于曲线或曲面的单位向量。">单位法向量</abbr></strong>。单位法向量在光照计算中非常重要，因此能够根据多边形的顶点计算出单位法向量将会非常有用。</p>

<p>矩阵只是一组数字的二维数组。一个具有 r 行和 c 列的矩阵称为 r 行 c 列的矩阵。如果 A 和 B 是矩阵，并且 A 的列数等于 B 的行数，则可以将 A 和 B 相乘得到矩阵积 AB。如果 A 是一个 n 行 m 列的矩阵，而 B 是一个 m 行 k 列的矩阵，则 AB 是一个 n 行 k 列的矩阵。特别地，两个 n 行 n 列的矩阵可以相乘得到另一个 n 行 n 列的矩阵。</p>
<p>一个 n 维向量可以被视为一个 n 行 1 列的矩阵。如果 A 是一个 n 行 n 列的矩阵，而 v 是一个 n 维向量，被视为一个 n 行 1 列的矩阵，那么乘积 Av 再次是一个 n 维向量。一个 3 行 3 列矩阵 A 和一个 3 维向量 <code>v = (x,y,z)</code> 的乘积通常显示如下：</p>

<p>注意，乘积 Av 中的第 i 个坐标简单地是矩阵 A 的第 i 行与向量 v 的点积。</p>
<p>利用向量乘以矩阵的这个定义，矩阵定义了一种变换，可以应用于一个向量以产生另一个向量。用这种方式定义的变换称为线性变换，它们是线性代数中的主要研究对象。<abbr title="从一个向量空间到另一个向量空间的函数，保持向量加法和常数乘法。线性变换可以用矩阵表示。在计算机图形中，它们用于实现旋转和平移等几何操作。">线性变换</abbr> L 具有以下特性：对于两个向量 v 和 w，<code>L(v+w) = L(v) + L(w)</code>，对于一个数 s，<code>L(sv) = sL(v)</code>。</p>
<p>旋转和缩放是线性变换，但平移不是线性变换。为了包含平移，我们必须将我们的变换视野扩展到包括仿射变换。粗略地说，仿射变换可以定义为先进行线性变换，然后进行平移。几何上，仿射变换是一种保持平行线的变换；也就是说，如果两条线是平行的，那么它们在仿射变换下的图像也将是平行线。对于计算机图形学，我们对三维仿射变换感兴趣。然而——通过一个乍看起来非常奇怪的技巧——我们可以通过进入第四维度将我们的视野重新聚焦到线性变换上。</p>
<p>首先注意，在三维空间中的仿射变换将一个向量 (x1,y1,z1) 转换为由以下公式给出的向量 (x2,y2,z2)：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>x2 = a1*x1 + a2*y1 + a3*z1 + t1
y2 = b1*x1 + b2*y1 + b3*z1 + t2
z2 = c1*x1 + c2*y1 + c3*z1 + t3
</code></pre></div>

<p>然后在 x 方向平移 t1，y 方向平移 t2，z 方向平移 t3。关键在于用四维向量 (x,y,z,1) 替换每个三维向量 (x,y,z)，在作为第四个坐标加入一个 "1"。而不是使用 3 行 3 列的矩阵，我们使用 4 行 4 列的矩阵</p>

<p>如果将向量 (x1,y1,z1,1) 乘以这个 4 行 4 列的矩阵，结果正好是向量 (x2,y2,z2,1)。也就是说，不是对 3D <abbr title="向量空间中的元素。向量空间的元素可以相加，并且可以乘以常数。对于计算机图形，向量只是包含两个、三个或四个数字的列表或数组。在这个意义上，向量通常用于表示2D、3D或4D空间中的点。然而，准确地说，向量表示具有长度和方向的数量；以这种方式使用的向量可以被可视化为箭头。">向量</abbr> (x1,y1,z1) 应用仿射变换，而是对 4D <abbr title="向量空间中的元素。向量空间的元素可以相加，并且可以乘以常数。对于计算机图形，向量只是包含两个、三个或四个数字的列表或数组。在这个意义上，向量通常用于表示2D、3D或4D空间中的点。然而，准确地说，向量表示具有长度和方向的数量；以这种方式使用的向量可以被可视化为箭头。">向量</abbr> (x1,y1,z1,1) 应用线性变换。</p>
