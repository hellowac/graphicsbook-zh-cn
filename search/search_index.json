<p>The main focus of this book is three-dimensional (3D) graphics, where most of the work goes into producing a 3D model of a scene. But ultimately, in almost all cases, the end result of a computer graphics project is a two-dimensional image. And of course, the direct production and manipulation of 2D images is an important topic in its own right. Furthermore, a lot of ideas carry over from two dimensions to three. So, it makes sense to start with graphics in 2D.</p> <p>An image that is presented on the computer screen is made up of pixels. The screen consists of a rectangular grid of pixels, arranged in rows and columns. The pixels are small enough that they are not easy to see individually. In fact, for many very high-resolution displays, they become essentially invisible. At a given time, each pixel can show only one color. Most screens these days use 24-bit color, where a color can be specified by three 8-bit numbers, giving the levels of red, green, and blue in the color. Any color that can be shown on the screen is made up of some combination of these three \"primary\" colors. Other formats are possible, such as grayscale, where each pixel is some shade of gray and the pixel color is given by one number that specifies the level of gray on a black-to-white scale. Typically, 256 shades of gray are used. Early computer screens used indexed color, where only a small set of colors, usually 16 or 256, could be displayed. For an indexed color display, there is a numbered list of possible colors, and the color of a pixel is specified by an integer giving the position of the color in the list.</p> <p>In any case, the color values for all the pixels on the screen are stored in a large block of memory known as a frame buffer. Changing the image on the screen requires changing color values that are stored in the frame buffer. The screen is redrawn many times per second, so that almost immediately after the color values are changed in the frame buffer, the colors of the pixels on the screen will be changed to match, and the displayed image will change.</p> <p>A computer screen used in this way is the basic model of raster graphics. The term \"raster\" technically refers to the mechanism used on older vacuum tube computer monitors: An electron beam would move along the rows of pixels, making them glow. The beam was moved across the screen by powerful magnets that would deflect the path of the electrons. The stronger the beam, the brighter the glow of the pixel, so the brightness of the pixels could be controlled by modulating the intensity of the electron beam. The color values stored in the frame buffer were used to determine the intensity of the electron beam. (For a color screen, each pixel had a red dot, a green dot, and a blue dot, which were separately illuminated by the beam.)</p> <p>A modern flat-screen computer monitor is not a raster in the same sense. There is no moving electron beam. The mechanism that controls the colors of the pixels is different for different types of screen. But the screen is still made up of pixels, and the color values for all the pixels are still stored in a frame buffer. The idea of an image consisting of a grid of pixels, with numerical color values for each pixel, defines raster graphics.</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u5b9a\u5355\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u989c\u8272\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6307\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u5305\u542b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7ebf\u6761\u3001\u5706\u5f62\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u548c\u77e9\u5f62\u7b49\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u5b9a\u4e49\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62(vector graphics)\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\uff1a\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5176\u5305\u542b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u589e\u52a0\u8da3\u5473\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f62\u72b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5177\u6709\u5c5e\u6027(attributes)\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7ebf\u6761\u7684\u7c97\u7ec6\u6216\u586b\u5145\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u65e5\u843d\u7167\u7247\uff08\u6216\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5176\u4ed6\u6444\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u7136\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5efa\u7b51\u84dd\u56fe\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u63d2\u56fe\uff0c\u5b83\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u597d\u3002</p> <p>\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\uff0c\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62\u751a\u81f3\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u3002\u5f53\u7b2c\u4e00\u6279\u56fe\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u663e\u793a\u5668\u95ee\u4e16\u65f6\uff0c\u5149\u6805\u663e\u793a\u5668\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u592a\u6162\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u592a\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u4e00\u6761\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u6cbf\u7740\u8be5\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\u675f\u3002\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62\u663e\u793a\u5668\u5c06\u5b58\u50a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6bb5\u663e\u793a\u5217\u8868(display list)\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7684\u70b9\u53ea\u4f1a\u5728\u88ab\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u7167\u5c04\u540e\u77ed\u6682\u53d1\u5149\uff0c\u56fe\u5f62\u663e\u793a\u5668\u4f1a\u4e00\u904d\u53c8\u4e00\u904d\u5730\u904d\u5386\u663e\u793a\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u91cd\u7ed8\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7ebf\u6761\u3002\u8981\u66f4\u6539\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6539\u663e\u793a\u5217\u8868\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5217\u8868\u53d8\u5f97\u592a\u957f\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5c31\u4f1a\u5f00\u59cb\u95ea\u70c1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e00\u6761\u7ebf\u5728\u4e0b\u6b21\u91cd\u65b0\u7ed8\u5236\u4e4b\u524d\u4f1a\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u53ef\u89c1\u5730\u6de1\u53bb\u3002</p> <p>\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u91cd\u70b9\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u5b9a\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u77e2\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u6765\u8868\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8981\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6805\u8868\u793a\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e00\u5343\u6761\u7ebf\u6bb5\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u77e2\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u60a8\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5b58\u50a8\u4e24\u5343\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5373\u7ebf\u6bb5\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u51e0\u5343\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u8981\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u6805\u663e\u793a\u7684\u5e27\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u540c\u6837\uff0c\u77e2\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u5149\u6805\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5728\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u7ebf\u6761\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5c06\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4ece\u5e27\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u590d\u5236\u5230\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\uff08\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u5149\u6805\u663e\u793a\u5668\u53d8\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u4ef7\u683c\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u53d6\u4ee3\u77e2\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u5668\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u76f8\u5f53\u597d\u5730\u663e\u793a\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\uff09</p> <p>Although images on the computer screen are represented using pixels, specifying individual pixel colors is not always the best way to create an image. Another way is to specify the basic geometric objects that it contains, shapes such as lines, circles, triangles, and rectangles. This is the idea that defines vector graphics: Represent an image as a list of the geometric shapes that it contains. To make things more interesting, the shapes can have attributes, such as the thickness of a line or the color that fills a rectangle. Of course, not every image can be composed from simple geometric shapes. This approach certainly wouldn't work for a picture of a beautiful sunset (or for most any other photographic image). However, it works well for many types of images, such as architectural blueprints and scientific illustrations.</p> <p>In fact, early in the history of computing, vector graphics was even used directly on computer screens. When the first graphical computer displays were developed, raster displays were too slow and expensive to be practical. Fortunately, it was possible to use vacuum tube technology in another way: The electron beam could be made to directly draw a line on the screen, simply by sweeping the beam along that line. A vector graphics display would store a display list of lines that should appear on the screen. Since a point on the screen would glow only very briefly after being illuminated by the electron beam, the graphics display would go through the display list over and over, continually redrawing all the lines on the list. To change the image, it would only be necessary to change the contents of the display list. Of course, if the display list became too long, the image would start to flicker because a line would have a chance to visibly fade before its next turn to be redrawn.</p> <p>But here is the point: For an image that can be specified as a reasonably small number of geometric shapes, the amount of information needed to represent the image is much smaller using a vector representation than using a raster representation. Consider an image made up of one thousand line segments. For a vector representation of the image, you only need to store the coordinates of two thousand points, the endpoints of the lines. This would take up only a few kilobytes of memory. To store the image in a frame buffer for a raster display would require much more memory. Similarly, a vector display could draw the lines on the screen more quickly than a raster display could copy the same image from the frame buffer to the screen.

<p>The divide between raster graphics and vector graphics persists in several areas of computer graphics. For example, it can be seen in a division between two categories of programs that can be used to create images: painting programs and drawing programs. In a painting program, the image is represented as a grid of pixels, and the user creates an image by assigning colors to pixels. This might be done by using a \"drawing tool\" that acts like a painter's brush, or even by tools that draw geometric shapes such as lines or rectangles. But the point in a painting program is to color the individual pixels, and it is only the pixel colors that are saved. To make this clearer, suppose that you use a painting program to draw a house, then draw a tree in front of the house. If you then erase the tree, you'll only reveal a blank background, not a house. In fact, the image never really contained a \"house\" at all\u2014only individually colored pixels that the viewer might perceive as making up a picture of a house.</p> <p>In a drawing program, the user creates an image by adding geometric shapes, and the image is represented as a list of those shapes. If you place a house shape (or collection of shapes making up a house) in the image, and you then place a tree shape on top of the house, the house is still there, since it is stored in the list of shapes that the image contains. If you delete the tree, the house will still be in the image, just as it was before you added the tree. Furthermore, you should be able to select one of the shapes in the image and move it or change its size, so drawing programs offer a rich set of editing operations that are not possible in painting programs. (The reverse, however, is also true.)</p> <p>A practical program for image creation and editing might combine elements of painting and drawing, although one or the other is usually dominant. For example, a drawing program might allow the user to include a raster-type image, treating it as one shape. A painting program might let the user create \"layers,\" which are separate images that can be layered one on top of another to create the final image. The layers can then be manipulated much like the shapes in a drawing program (so that you could keep both your house and your tree in separate layers, even if in the image of the house is in back of the tree).</p> <p>Two well-known graphics programs are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Photoshop is in the category of painting programs, while Illustrator is more of a drawing program. In the world of free software, the GNU image-processing program, Gimp, is a good alternative to Photoshop, while Inkscape is a reasonably capable free drawing program. Short introductions to Gimp and Inkscape can be found in Appendix C.</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587

<p>The divide between raster and vector graphics also appears in the field of graphics file formats. There are many ways to represent an image as data stored in a file. If the original image is to be recovered from the bits stored in the file, the representation must follow some exact, known specification. Such a specification is called a graphics file format. Some popular graphics file formats include GIF, PNG, JPEG, WebP, and SVG. Most images used on the Web are GIF, PNG, or JPEG, but most browsers also have support for SVG images and for the newer WebP format.</p> <p>GIF, PNG, JPEG, and WebP are basically raster graphics formats; an image is specified by storing a color value for each pixel. GIF is an older file format, which has largely been superseded by PNG, but you can still find GIF images on the web. (The GIF format supports animated images, so GIFs are often used for simple animations on Web pages.) GIF uses an indexed color model with a maximum of 256 colors. PNG can use either indexed or full 24-bit color, while JPEG is meant for full color images.</p> <p>The amount of data necessary to represent a raster image can be quite large. However, the data usually contains a lot of redundancy, and the data can be \"compressed\" to reduce its size. GIF and PNG use lossless data compression, which means that the original image can be recovered perfectly from the compressed data. JPEG uses a lossy data compression algorithm, which means that the image that is recovered from a JPEG file is not exactly the same as the original image; some information has been lost. This might not sound like a good idea, but in fact the difference is often not very noticeable, and using lossy compression usually permits a greater reduction in the size of the compressed data. JPEG generally works well for photographic images, but not as well for images that have sharp edges between different colors. It is especially bad for line drawings and images that contain text; PNG is the preferred format for such images. WebP can use both lossless and lossy compression.</p> <p>SVG, on the other hand, is fundamentally a vector graphics format (although SVG images can include raster images). SVG is actually an XML-based language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics images. \"SVG\" stands for \"Scalable Vector Graphics,\" and the term \"scalable\" indicates one of the advantages of vector graphics: There is no loss of quality when the size of the image is increased. A line between two points can be represented at any scale, and it is still the same perfect geometric line. If you try to greatly increase the size of a raster image, on the other hand, you will find that you don't have enough color values for all the pixels in the new image; each pixel from the original image will be expanded to cover a rectangle of pixels in the scaled image, and you will get multi-pixel blocks of uniform color. The scalable nature of SVG images make them a good choice for web browsers and for graphical elements on your computer's desktop. And indeed, some desktop environments are now using SVG images for their desktop icons.</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u65e0\u8bba\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u90fd\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5750\u6807\u7cfb(coordinate system)\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u3002\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u70b9\u7684\u5750\u6807\u3002\u70b9\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u79f0\u4e3a\u5176x\u5750\u6807\u548cy\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u540d\u79f0\"x\"\u548c\"y\"\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u7684\u3002</p> <p>\u5149\u6805\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u6392\u5217\u6210\u884c\u548c\u5217\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5b83\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e00\u5bf9\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u8be5\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u884c\u53f7\u548c\u5217\u53f7\u3002\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5e94\u8be5\u4ece\u4e0a\u5230\u4e0b\u8fd8\u662f\u4ece\u4e0b\u5230\u4e0a\u7f16\u53f7\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5206\u6b67\u3002\uff09</p> <p>\u5bf9\u4e8e\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u6570\u5750\u6807\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u7684\uff1b\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u6307\u5b9a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u6211\u4e0d\u60f3\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba8\u8bba\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u662f\u672c\u4e66\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u8981\u3002</p> <p>A digital image, no matter what its format, is specified using a coordinate system. A coordinate system sets up a correspondence between numbers and geometric points. In two dimensions, each point is assigned a pair of numbers, which are called the coordinates of the point. The two coordinates of a point are often called its x-coordinate and y-coordinate, although the names \"x\" and \"y\" are arbitrary.</p> <p>A raster image is a two-dimensional grid of pixels arranged into rows and columns. As such, it has a natural coordinate system in which each pixel corresponds to a pair of integers giving the number of the row and the number of the column that contain the pixel. (Even in this simple case, there is some disagreement as to whether the rows should be numbered from top-to-bottom or from bottom-to-top.)</p> <p>For a vector image, it is natural to use real-number coordinates. The coordinate system for an image is arbitrary to some degree; that is, the same image can be specified using different coordinate systems. I do not want to say a lot about coordinate systems here, but they will be a major focus of a large part of the book, and they are even more important in three-dimensional graphics than in two dimensions.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c1/s2/","title":"\u7b2c 2 \u8282\uff1a\u4e09\u7ef4(3D)\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u8981\u7d20","text":"<p>Elements of 3D Graphics</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587

<p>When we turn to 3D graphics, we find that the most common approaches have more in common with vector graphics than with raster graphics. That is, the content of an image is specified as a list of geometric objects. The technique is referred to as geometric modeling. The starting point is to construct an \"artificial 3D world\" as a collection of simple geometric shapes, arranged in three-dimensional space. The objects can have attributes that, combined with global properties of the world, determine the appearance of the objects. Often, the range of basic shapes is very limited, perhaps including only points, line segments, and triangles. A more complex shape such as a polygon or sphere can be built or approximated as a collection of more basic shapes, if it is not itself considered to be basic. To make a two-dimensional image of the scene, the scene is projected from three dimensions down to two dimensions. Projection is the equivalent of taking a photograph of the scene. Let's look at how it all works in a little more detail.</p> <p>First, the geometry.... We start with an empty 3D space or \"world.\" Of course, this space exists only conceptually, but it's useful to think of it as real and to be able to visualize it in your mind. The space needs a coordinate system that associates each point in the space with three numbers, usually referred to as the x, y, and z coordinates of the point. This coordinate system is referred to as \"world coordinates.\"</p> <p>We want to build a scene inside the world, made up of geometric objects. For example, we can specify a line segment in the scene by giving the coordinates of its two endpoints, and we can specify a triangle by giving the coordinates of its three vertices. The smallest building blocks that we have to work with, such as line segments and triangles, are called geometric primitives. Different graphics systems make different sets of primitives available, but in many cases only very basic shapes such as lines and triangles are considered primitive. A complex scene can contain a large number of primitives, and it would be very difficult to create the scene by giving explicit coordinates for each individual primitive. The solution, as any programmer should immediately guess, is to chunk together primitives into reusable components. For example, for a scene that contains several automobiles, we might create a geometric model of a wheel. An automobile can be modeled as four wheels together with models of other components. And we could then use several copies of the automobile model in the scene. Note that once a geometric model has been designed, it can be used as a component in more complex models. This is referred to as hierarchical modeling.</p> <p>Suppose that we have constructed a model of a wheel out of geometric primitives. When that wheel is moved into position in the model of an automobile, the coordinates of all of its primitives will have to be adjusted. So what exactly have we gained by building the wheel? The point is that all of the coordinates in the wheel are adjusted in the same way. That is, to place the wheel in the automobile, we just have to specify a single adjustment that is applied to the wheel as a whole. The type of \"adjustment\" that is used is called a geometric transform (or geometric transformation). A geometric transform is used to adjust the size, orientation, and position of a geometric object. When making a model of an automobile, we build one wheel. We then apply four different transforms to the wheel model to add four copies of the wheel to the automobile. Similarly, we can add several automobiles to a scene by applying different transforms to the same automobile model.</p> <p>The three most basic kinds of geometric transform are called scaling, rotation, and translation. A scaling transform is used to set the size of an object, that is, to make it bigger or smaller by some specified factor. A rotation transform is used to set an object's orientation, by rotating it by some angle about some specific axis. A translation transform is used to set the position of an object, by displacing it by a given amount from its original position. In this book, we will meet these transformations first in two dimensions, where they are easier to understand. But it is in 3D graphics that they become truly essential.</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u662f\u5916\u89c2... \u5355\u72ec\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u4f60\u5fc5\u987b\u80fd\u591f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed9\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u914d\u5c5e\u6027(attributes)\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u662f\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8fdc\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u6307\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u989c\u8272\u8981\u590d\u6742\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u57283D\u56fe\u5f62\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8c08\u8bba\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8c08\u8bba\u6750\u8d28(material)\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u6307\u7684\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u8868\u9762\u56fa\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u51fb\u4e2d\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u672c\u989c\u8272\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5149\u6cfd\u5ea6(shininess)\u3001\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6(roughness)\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6(transparency)\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u7eb9\u7406(texture)\u3002\u5728\u6700\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u4e2d\uff0c\u7eb9\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8868\u9762\u70b9\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u7eb9\u7406\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7528\u9014\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u540c\u70b9\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3002\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7eb9\u7406\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u56fe\u50cf\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u201c\u7ed8\u5236\u201d\u5728\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7eb9\u7406\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6216\u201c\u51f9\u51f8\u4e0d\u5e73\u201d\u3002\u7eb9\u7406\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u800c\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5e26\u6709\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u3002</p> <p>\u6750\u8d28\u662f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684 \u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027 (intrinsic property)\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5916\u89c2\u8fd8\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u6240\u5904\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5149\u7ebf\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4f60\u770b\u4e0d\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u57283D\u56fe\u5f62\u4e2d\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\uff1a\u4f60\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0 \u6a21\u62df\u5149\u7ebf(simulated lighting)\u3002\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u5149\u6e90\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5149\u6e90\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u6216\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u5149\u5c06\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u56fe\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u7167\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u76f8\u5f53\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u975e\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002</p> <p>Next, appearance.... Geometric shapes by themselves are not very interesting. You have to be able to set their appearance. This is done by assigning attributes to the geometric objects. An obvious attribute is color, but getting a realistic appearance turns out to be a lot more complicated than simply specifying a color for each primitive. In 3D graphics, instead of color, we usually talk about material. The term material here refers to the properties that determine the intrinsic visual appearance of a surface. Essentially, this means how the surface interacts with light that hits the surface. Material properties can include a basic color as well as other properties such as shininess, roughness, and transparency.</p> <p>One of the most useful kinds of material property is a texture. In most general terms, a texture is a way of varying material properties from point-to-point on a surface. The most common use of texture is to allow different colors for different points. This is often done by using a 2D image as a texture. The image can be applied to a surface so that the image looks like it is \"painted\" onto the surface. However, texture can also refer to changing values for things like transparency or \"bumpiness.\" Textures allow us to add detail to a scene without using a huge number of geometric primitives; instead, you can use a smaller number of textured primitives.</p> <p>A material is an intrinsic property of an object, but the actual appearance of the object also depends on the environment in which the object is viewed. In the real world, you don't see anything unless there is some light in the environment. The same is true in 3D graphics: you have to add simulated lighting to a scene. There can be several sources of light in a scene. Each light source can have its own color, intensity, and direction or position. The light from those sources will then interact with the material properties of the objects in the scene. Support for lighting in a graphics system can range from fairly simple to very complex and computationally intensive.</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf... \u4e00\u822c\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c3D\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u751f\u62103D\u4e16\u754c\u76842D\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u4ece3D\u52302D\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u6d89\u53ca\u89c6\u56fe(viewing)\u548c\u6295\u5f71(projection)\u3002\u5f53\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u89c2\u5bdf\u65f6\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6307\u5b9a\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u671d\u5411\u3002\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6307\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u4e0a(up)\u201d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c06\u6307\u5411\u4e0a\u65b9\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u770b\u4f5c\u662f\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u201d\u653e\u7f6e\u5230\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u4ece\u90a3\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u770b\u5230\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6295\u5f71\u52302D\u4e2d\u3002\u6295\u5f71\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u62cd\u7167\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u7ec8\u76843D\u56fe\u5f62\u6b65\u9aa4\u662f\u5c06\u989c\u8272\u5206\u914d\u7ed92D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u79f0\u4e3a\u5149\u6805\u5316(rasterization)\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u6e32\u67d3(rendering)\u573a\u666f\u3002</p> <p>\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u5355\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u753b(animation)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u523b\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u4efb\u4f55\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u671f\u95f4\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u5750\u6807\u3001\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u4f7f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u589e\u957f\u3002\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u671f\u95f4\u6539\u53d8\u89c6\u56fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5f97\u6548\u679c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u5728\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u98de\u884c\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce(physics engine)\u201d\uff0c\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\uff08\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u672c\u4e66\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\uff09</p> <p>Finally, the image.... In general, the ultimate goal of 3D graphics is to produce 2D images of the 3D world. The transformation from 3D to 2D involves viewing and projection. The world looks different when seen from different points of view. To set up a point of view, we need to specify the position of the viewer and the direction that the viewer is looking. It is also necessary to specify an \"up\" direction, a direction that will be pointing upwards in the final image. This can be thought of as placing a \"virtual camera\" into the scene. Once the view is set up, the world as seen from that point of view can be projected into 2D. Projection is analogous to taking a picture with the camera.</p> <p>The final step in 3D graphics is to assign colors to individual pixels in the 2D image. This process is called rasterization, and the whole process of producing an image is referred to as rendering the scene.</p> <p>In many cases the ultimate goal is not to create a single image, but to create an animation, consisting of a sequence of images that show the world at different times. In an animation, there are small changes from one image in the sequence to the next. Almost any aspect of a scene can change during an animation, including coordinates of primitives, transformations, material properties, and the view. For example, an object can be made to grow over the course of an animation by gradually increasing the scale factor in a scaling transformation that is applied to the object. And changing the view during an animation can give the effect of moving or flying through the scene. Of course, it can be difficult to compute the necessary changes. There are many techniques to help with the computation. One of the most important is to use a \"physics engine,\" which computes the motion and interaction of objects based on the laws of physics. (However, you won't learn about physics engines in this book.)</p>"},{"location":"cn/c1/s3/","title":"\u7b2c 3 \u8282\uff1a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6","text":"<p>Hardware and Software</p>

<p>We will be using OpenGL as the primary basis for 3D graphics programming. The original version of OpenGL was released in 1992 by a company named Silicon Graphics, which was known for its graphics workstations\u2014powerful, expensive computers designed for intensive graphical applications. (Today, you have more graphics computing power on your smart phone.) OpenGL is supported by the graphics hardware in most modern computing devices, including desktop computers, laptops, and many mobile devices. In the form of WebGL, it is the used for most 3D graphics on the Web. This section will give you a bit of background about the history of OpenGL and about the graphics hardware that supports it.</p> <p>In the first desktop computers, the contents of the screen were managed directly by the CPU. For example, to draw a line segment on the screen, the CPU would run a loop to set the color of each pixel that lies along the line. Needless to say, graphics could take up a lot of the CPU's time. And graphics performance was very slow, compared to what we expect today. So what has changed? Computers are much faster in general, of course, but the big change is that in modern computers, graphics processing is done by a specialized component called a GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit. A GPU includes processors for doing graphics computations; in fact, it can include a large number of such processors that work in parallel to greatly speed up graphical operations. It also includes its own dedicated memory for storing things like images and lists of coordinates. GPU processors have very fast access to data that is stored in GPU memory\u2014much faster than their access to data stored in the computer's main memory.</p> <p>To draw a line or perform some other graphical operation, the CPU simply has to send commands, along with any necessary data, to the GPU, which is responsible for actually carrying out those commands. The CPU offloads most of the graphical work to the GPU, which is optimized to carry out that work very quickly. The set of commands that the GPU understands make up the API of the GPU. OpenGL is an example of a graphics API, and most GPUs support OpenGL in the sense that they can understand OpenGL commands, or at least that OpenGL commands can efficiently be translated into commands that the GPU can understand.</p> <p>OpenGL is not the only graphics API. In fact, it is in the process of being replaced by more modern alternatives, including Vulkan an open API from the same group that is responsible for OpenGL. There are also proprietary APIs used by Apple and Microsoft: Metal and Direct3D. As for the Web, a new API called WebGPU has been under development for some time and is already implemented in some Web browsers. These newer APIs are complex and low-level. They are designed more for speed and efficiency rather than ease-of-use. Metal, Direct3D, and Vulkan are not covered in this textbook, but WebGPU is introduced in Chapter 9. For most of the book, we will use OpenGL, because it provides an easier introduction to 3D graphics, and WebGL, because it is still the major API for 3D graphics in Web browsers.</p>

<p>I have said that OpenGL is an API, but in fact it is a series of APIs that have been subject to repeated extension and revision. In 2023, the current (and perhaps final) version is 4.6, which was first released in 2017. It is very different from the 1.0 version from 1992. Furthermore, there is a specialized version called OpenGL ES for \"embedded systems\" such as mobile phones and tablets. And there is also WebGL, for use in Web browsers, which is basically a port of OpenGL ES. It will be useful to know something about how and why OpenGL has changed.</p> <p>First of all, you should know that OpenGL was designed as a \"client/server\" system. The server, which is responsible for controlling the computer's display and performing graphics computations, carries out commands issued by the client. Typically, the server is a GPU, including its graphics processors and memory. The server executes OpenGL commands. The client is the CPU in the same computer, along with the application program that it is running. OpenGL commands come from the program that is running on the CPU. However, it is actually possible to run OpenGL programs remotely over a network. That is, you can execute an application program on a remote computer (the OpenGL client), while the graphics computations and display are done on the computer that you are actually using (the OpenGL server).</p> <p>The key idea is that the client and the server are separate components, and there is a communication channel between those components. OpenGL commands and the data that they need are communicated from the client (the CPU) to the server (the GPU) over that channel. The capacity of the channel can be a limiting factor in graphics performance. Think of drawing an image onto the screen. If the GPU can draw the image in microseconds, but it takes milliseconds to send the data for the image from the CPU to the GPU, then the great speed of the GPU is irrelevant\u2014most of the time that it takes to draw the image is communication time.</p> <p>For this reason, one of the driving factors in the evolution of OpenGL has been the desire to limit the amount of communication that is needed between the CPU and the GPU. One approach is to store information in the GPU's memory. If some data is going to be used several times, it can be transmitted to the GPU once and stored in memory there, where it will be immediately accessible to the GPU. Another approach is to try to decrease the number of OpenGL commands that must be transmitted to the GPU to draw a given image.</p> <p>OpenGL draws primitives such as triangles. Specifying a primitive means specifying coordinates and attributes for each of its vertices. In the original OpenGL 1.0, a separate command was used to specify the coordinates of each vertex, and a command was needed each time the value of an attribute changed. To draw a single triangle would require three or more commands. Drawing a complex object made up of thousands of triangles would take many thousands of commands. Even in OpenGL 1.1, it became possible to draw such an object with a single command instead of thousands. All the data for the object would be loaded into arrays, which could then be sent in a single step to the GPU. Unfortunately, if the object was going to be drawn more than once, then the data would have to be retransmitted each time the object was drawn. This was fixed in OpenGL 1.5 with Vertex Buffer Objects. A VBO is a block of memory in the GPU that can store the coordinates or attribute values for a set of vertices. This makes it possible to reuse the data without having to retransmit it from the CPU to the GPU every time it is used.</p> <p>Similarly, OpenGL 1.1 introduced texture objects to make it possible to store several images on the GPU for use as textures. This means that texture images that are going to be reused several times can be loaded once into the GPU, so that the GPU can easily switch between images without having to reload them.</p>

capabilities were added to OpenGL, the API grew in size. But the growth was still outpaced by the invention of new, more sophisticated techniques for doing graphics. Some of these new techniques were added to OpenGL, but the problem is that no matter how many features you add, there will always be demands for new features\u2014as well as complaints that all the new features are making things too complicated! OpenGL was a giant machine, with new pieces always being tacked onto it, but still not pleasing everyone. The real solution was to make the machine programmable. With OpenGL 2.0, it became possible to write programs to be executed as part of the graphical computation in the GPU. The programs are run on the GPU at GPU speed. A programmer who wants to use a new graphics technique can write a program to implement the feature and just hand it to the GPU. The OpenGL API doesn't have to be changed. The only thing that the API has to support is the ability to send programs to the GPU for execution.</p> <p>The programs are called shaders (although the term doesn't really describe what most of them actually do). The first shaders to be introduced were vertex shaders and fragment shaders. When a primitive is drawn, some work has to be done at each vertex of the primitive, such as applying a geometric transform to the vertex coordinates or using the attributes and global lighting environment to compute the color of that vertex. A vertex shader is a program that can take over the job of doing such \"per-vertex\" computations. Similarly, some work has to be done for each pixel inside the primitive. A fragment shader can take over the job of performing such \"per-pixel\" computations. (Fragment shaders are also called pixel shaders.)</p> <p>The idea of programmable graphics hardware was very successful\u2014so successful that in OpenGL 3.0, the usual per-vertex and per-fragment processing was deprecated (meaning that its use was discouraged). And in OpenGL 3.1, it was removed from the OpenGL standard, although it is still present as an optional extension. In practice, all the original features of OpenGL are still supported in desktop versions of OpenGL and will probably continue to be available in the future. On the embedded system side, however, with OpenGL ES 2.0 and later, the use of shaders is mandatory, and a large part of the OpenGL 1.1 API has been completely removed. WebGL, the version of OpenGL for use in web browsers, is based on OpenGL ES, and it also requires shaders to get anything at all done. Nevertheless, we will begin our study of OpenGL with version 1.1. Most of the concepts and many of the details from that version are still relevant, and it offers an easier entry point for someone new to 3D graphics programming.</p> <p>OpenGL shaders are written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). Like OpenGL itself, GLSL has gone through several versions. We will spend some time later in the course studying GLSL ES, the version used with WebGL and OpenGL ES. GLSL uses a syntax similar to the C programming language.</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u70b9\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u9876\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5927\u6982\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0cGPU\u53ef\u4ee5\u62e5\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u751a\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3002\u8bda\u7136\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fdc\u4e0d\u53caCPU\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5178\u578b\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u7684\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u76f8\u5f53\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684GPU\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u3002</p> <p>As a final remark on GPU hardware, I should note that the computations that are done for different vertices are pretty much independent, and so can potentially be done in parallel. The same is true of the computations for different fragments. In fact, GPUs can have hundreds or thousands of processors that can operate in parallel. Admittedly, the individual processors are much less powerful than a CPU, but then typical per-vertex and per-fragment computations are not very complicated. The large number of processors, and the large amount of parallelism that is possible in graphics computations, makes for impressive graphics performance even on fairly inexpensive GPUs.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/","title":"\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0 \u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\u7ed8\u5236","text":"<p>Two-Dimensional Graphics</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u7ae0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e8b\u60c5\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u6bd4\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5f62\u8c61\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7ae0\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u4e5f\u5c06\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u975e\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u3002</p> <p>\u672c\u7ae0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u68c0\u89c6\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u6216\u56fe\u5f62API\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4f2a\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u5199\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u8ba9\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7f16\u7a0b\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u67e5\u770b\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Graphics2D\u7684Java\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HTML &lt;canvas&gt;\u56fe\u5f62\u7684JavaScript\u4ee5\u53caSVG\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u7ae0\u524d\u9762\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u901a\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u3002</p> <p>\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0\u5185\u5bb9:</p> <ul> <li>\u7b2c1\u8282: \u50cf\u7d20\u3001\u5750\u6807\u548c\u989c\u8272</li> <li>\u7b2c2\u8282: \u5f62\u72b6</li> <li>\u7b2c3\u8282: \u53d8\u6362</li> <li>\u7b2c4\u8282: \u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21</li> <li>\u7b2c5\u8282: Java Graphics2D</li> <li>\u7b2c6\u8282: HTML Canvas\u56fe\u5f62</li> <li>\u7b2c7\u8282: SVG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bed\u8a00</li> </ul> <p>With this chapter, we begin our study of computer graphics by looking at the two-dimensional case.

The coding examples in these sections are written in pseudocode that should make sense to anyone with enough programming background to be reading this book. In the next three sections, we will take quick looks at 2D graphics in three particular languages: Java with Graphics2D, JavaScript with HTML &lt;canvas&gt; graphics, and SVG.

<p>A digital image is made up of rows and columns of pixels. A pixel in such an image can be specified by saying which column and which row contains it. In terms of coordinates, a pixel can be identified by a pair of integers giving the column number and the row number. For example, the pixel with coordinates (3,5) would lie in column number 3 and row number 5. Conventionally, columns are numbered from left to right, starting with zero. Most graphics systems, including the ones we will study in this chapter, number rows from top to bottom, starting from zero. Some, including OpenGL, number the rows from bottom to top instead.</p> <p> pixel coordinates </p> <p>Note in particular that the pixel that is identified by a pair of coordinates (x,y) depends on the choice of coordinate system. You always need to know what coordinate system is in use before you know what point you are talking about.</p> <p>Row and column numbers identify a pixel, not a point. A pixel contains many points; mathematically, it contains an infinite number of points. The goal of computer graphics is not really to color pixels\u2014it is to create and manipulate images. In some ideal sense, an image should be defined by specifying a color for each point, not just for each pixel. Pixels are an approximation. If we imagine that there is a true, ideal image that we want to display, then any image that we display by coloring pixels is an approximation. This has many implications.</p> <p>Suppose, for example, that we want to draw a line segment. A mathematical line has no thickness and would be invisible. So we really want to draw a thick line segment, with some specified width. Let's say that the line should be one pixel wide. The problem is that, unless the line is horizontal or vertical, we can't actually draw the line by coloring pixels. A diagonal geometric line will cover some pixels only partially. It is not possible to make part of a pixel black and part of it white. When you try to draw a line with black and white pixels only, the result is a jagged staircase effect. This effect is an example of something called \"aliasing.\" Aliasing can also be seen in the outlines of characters drawn on the screen and in diagonal or curved boundaries between any two regions of different color. (The term aliasing likely comes from the fact that ideal images are naturally described in real-number coordinates. When you try to represent the image using pixels, many real-number coordinates will map to the same integer pixel coordinates; they can all be considered as different names or \"aliases\" for the same pixel.)</p> <p>Antialiasing is a term for techniques that are designed to mitigate the effects of aliasing. The idea is that when a pixel is only partially covered by a shape, the color of the pixel should be a mixture of the color of the shape and the color of the background. When drawing a black line on a white background, the color of a partially covered pixel would be gray, with the shade of gray depending on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the line. (In practice, calculating this area exactly for each pixel would be too difficult, so some approximate method is used.) Here, for example, is a geometric line, shown on the left, along with two approximations of that line made by coloring pixels. The lines are greatly magnified so that you can see the individual pixels. The line on the right is drawn using antialiasing, while the one in the middle is not:</p> <p> antialiased line </p> <p>Note that antialiasing does not give a perfect image, but it can reduce the \"jaggies\" that are caused by aliasing (at least when it is viewed on a normal scale).</p> <p>There are other issues involved in mapping real-number coordinates to pixels. For example, which point in a pixel should correspond to integer-valued coordinates such as (3,5)? The center of the pixel? One of the corners of the pixel? In general, we think of the numbers as referring to the top-left corner of the pixel. Another way of thinking about this is to say that integer coordinates refer to the lines between pixels, rather than to the pixels themselves. But that still doesn't determine exactly which pixels are affected when a geometric shape is drawn. For example, here are two lines drawn using HTML canvas graphics, shown greatly magnified. The lines were specified to be colored black with a one-pixel line width:</p> <p> horizontal lines from canvas </p> <p>The top line was drawn from the point (100,100) to the point (120,100). In canvas graphics, integer coordinates correspond to the lines between pixels, but when a one-pixel line is drawn, it extends one-half pixel on either side of the infinitely thin geometric line. So for the top line, the line as it is drawn lies half in one row of pixels and half in another row. The graphics system, which uses antialiasing, rendered the line by coloring both rows of pixels gray. The bottom line was drawn from the point (100.5,100.5) to (120.5,100.5). In this case, the line lies exactly along one line of pixels, which gets colored black. The gray pixels at the ends of the bottom line have to do with the fact that the line only extends halfway into the pixels at its endpoints. Other graphics systems might render the same lines differently.</p> <p>The following interactive demo lets you experiment with pixels and antialiasing. (Note that in any of the interactive demos that accompany this book, you can click the question mark icon in the upper left for more information about how to use it.)</p> <p></p> <p>All this is complicated further by the fact that pixels aren't what they used to be. Pixels today are smaller! The resolution of a display device can be measured in terms of the number of pixels per inch on the display, a quantity referred to as PPI (pixels per inch) or sometimes DPI (dots per inch). Early screens tended to have resolutions of somewhere close to 72 PPI. At that resolution, and at a typical viewing distance, individual pixels are clearly visible. For a while, it seemed like most displays had about 100 pixels per inch, but high resolution displays today can have 200, 300 or even 400 pixels per inch. At the highest resolutions, individual pixels can no longer be distinguished.</p> <p>The fact that pixels come in such a range of sizes is a problem if we use coordinate systems based on pixels. An image created assuming that there are 100 pixels per inch will look tiny on a 400 PPI display. A one-pixel-wide line looks good at 100 PPI, but at 400 PPI, a one-pixel-wide line is probably too thin.</p> <p>In fact, in many graphics systems, \"pixel\" doesn't really refer to the size of a physical pixel. Instead, it is just another unit of measure, which is set by the system to be something appropriate. (On a desktop system, a pixel is usually about one one-hundredth of an inch. On a smart phone, which is usually viewed from a closer distance, the value might be closer to 1/160 inch. Furthermore, the meaning of a pixel as a unit of measure can change when, for example, the user applies a magnification to a web page.)</p> <p>Pixels cause problems that have not been completely solved. Fortunately, they are less of a problem for vector graphics, which is mostly what we will use in this book. For vector graphics, pixels only become an issue during rasterization, the step in which a vector image is converted into pixels for display. The vector image itself can be created using any convenient coordinate system. It represents an idealized, resolution-independent image. A rasterized image is an approximation of that ideal image, but how to do the approximation can be left to the display hardware.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s1/#212--\u5b9e\u6570\u5750\u6807\u7cfb","title":"2.1.2  \u5b9e\u6570\u5750\u6807\u7cfb","text":"<p>Real-number Coordinate Systems</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u5f62\u7ed8\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u4f1a\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e9\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u7ed8\u5236\u4e00\u4e9b\u56fe\u5f62\u539f\u8bed(graphics primitives)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u67d0\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u77e9\u5f62\u4e0a\u6307\u5b9a\u539f\u8bed\u3002\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u77e9\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u4e2a15\u82f1\u5c3a\u4e5812\u82f1\u5c3a\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\uff0c\u5219\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u5e0c\u671b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4e00\u82f1\u5c3a\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5750\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u4ece\u6c34\u5e73\u65b9\u5411\u76840\u523015\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u76840\u523012\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u4f4d\u662f\u82f1\u5c3a\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e00\u4e2a\u82f1\u5c3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u50cf\u7d20\u3002\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u5750\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5b9e\u6570\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6574\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u5fd8\u8bb0\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u70b9\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u5c06\u7531\u4e00\u5bf9\u5b9e\u6570\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u3002</p> <p>\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u77e9\u5f62\u4e0a\u6307\u5b9a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u60a8\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6307\u5b9a\u77e9\u5f62\u5de6\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u53f3\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9876\u90e8\u548c\u5e95\u90e8\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u5750\u6807\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u503c\u79f0\u4e3aleft\u3001right\u3001top\u548cbottom\u3002\u901a\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662fxmin\u3001xmax\u3001ymin\u548cymax\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5982top\u5c0f\u4e8ebottom\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u5e0c\u671b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5782\u76f4\u5750\u6807\u4ece\u4e0b\u5230\u4e0a\u9012\u589e\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ece\u4e0a\u5230\u4e0b\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9876\u90e8\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u7684y\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002</p> <p>\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u6307\u5b9a\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982</p> <pre><code>setCoordinateSystem(left,right,bottom,top)\n</code></pre> <p>\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u56fe\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8d1f\u8d23\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u6307\u5b9a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u3002\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u624b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6c\u6362\u662f\u6709\u7528\u7684\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u70b9\u7684\u5750\u6807\u3002\uff08\u8bf7\u8bb0\u4f4f\uff0c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed9\u70b9\u5206\u914d\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u70b9\uff01\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u9650\u5236\u4e3aoldLeft\u3001oldRight\u3001oldTop\u548coldBottom\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4e3anewLeft\u3001newRight\u3001newTop\u548cnewBottom\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5750\u6807\u4e3a(oldX,oldY)\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u627e\u5230\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8be5\u70b9\u7684\u5750\u6807(newX,newY)</p> <p> old to new coords </p> <p>newX \u548c newY \u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a</p> <pre><code>newX = newLeft + ((oldX -

Primitives are specified using some coordinate system on the rectangle. It should be possible to select a coordinate system that is appropriate for the application. For example, if the rectangle represents a floor plan for a 15 foot by 12 foot room, then you might want to use a coordinate system in which the unit of measure is one foot and the coordinates range from 0 to 15 in the horizontal direction and 0 to 12 in the vertical direction. The unit of measure in this case is feet rather than pixels, and one foot can correspond to many pixels in the image. The coordinates for a pixel will, in general, be real numbers rather than integers. In fact, it's better to forget about pixels and just think about points in the image. A point will have a pair of coordinates given by real numbers.</p> <p>To specify the coordinate system on a rectangle, you just have to specify the horizontal coordinates for the left and right edges of the rectangle and the vertical coordinates for the top and bottom. Let's call these values left, right, top, and bottom. Often, they are thought of as xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax, but there is no reason to assume that, for example, top is less than bottom. We might want a coordinate system in which the vertical coordinate increases from bottom to top instead of from top to bottom. In that case, top will correspond to the maximum y-value instead of the minimum value.</p> <p>To allow programmers to specify the coordinate system that they would like to use, it would be good to have a subroutine such as</p> <pre><code>setCoordinateSystem(left,right,bottom,top)\n</code></pre> <p>The graphics system would then be responsible for automatically transforming the coordinates from the specified coordinate system into pixel coordinates. Such a subroutine might not be available, so it's useful to see how the transformation is done by hand. Let's consider the general case. Given coordinates for a point in one coordinate system, we want to find the coordinates for the same point in a second coordinate system. (Remember that a coordinate system is just a way of assigning numbers to points. It's the points that are real!) Suppose that the horizontal and vertical limits are oldLeft, oldRight, oldTop, and oldBottom for the first coordinate system, and are newLeft, newRight, newTop, and newBottom for the second. Suppose that a point has coordinates (oldX,oldY) in the first coordinate system. We want to find the coordinates (newX,newY) of the point in the second coordinate system</p> <p> old to new coords </p> <p>Formulas for newX and newY are then given by</p> <pre><code>newX = newLeft + \n      ((oldX - oldLeft) / (oldRight - oldLeft)) * (newRight - newLeft))\nnewY = newTop + \n        ((oldY - oldTop) / (oldBottom - oldTop)) * (newBottom - newTop)\n</code></pre> <p>The logic here is that oldX is located at a certain fraction of the distance from oldLeft to oldRight. That fraction is given by</p> <pre><code>((oldX - oldLeft) / (oldRight - oldLeft))\n</code></pre> <p>The formula for newX just says that newX should lie at the same fraction of the distance from newLeft to newRight. You can also check the formulas by testing that they work when oldX is equal to oldLeft or to oldRight, and when oldY is equal to oldBottom or to oldTop.</p> <p>As an example, suppose that we want to transform some real-number coordinate system with limits left, right, top, and bottom into pixel coordinates that range from 0 at left to 800 at the right and from 0 at the top 600 at the bottom. In that case, newLeft and newTop are zero, and the formulas become simply</p> <pre><code>newX = ((oldX - left) / (right - left)) * 800\nnewY = ((oldY - top) / (bottom - top)) * 600\n</code></pre> <p>Of course, this gives newX and newY as real numbers, and they will have to be rounded or truncated to integer values if we need integer coordinates for pixels. The reverse transformation\u2014going from pixel coordinates to real number coordinates\u2014is also useful. For example, if the image is displayed on a computer screen, and you want to react to mouse clicks on the image, you will probably get the mouse coordinates in terms of integer pixel coordinates, but you will want to transform those pixel coordinates into your own chosen coordinate system.</p> <p>In practice, though, you won't usually have to do the transformations yourself, since most graphics APIs provide some higher level way to specify transforms. We will talk more about this in Section 2.3.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s1/#213--\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4","title":"2.1.3  \u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4","text":"<p>Aspect Ratio</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4(aspect ratio)\u662f\u5176\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e3a2:1\u610f\u5473\u7740\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u800c\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e3a4:3\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5bbd\u5ea6\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76844/3\u500d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u5bbd\u5ea6:\u9ad8\u5ea6(width:height)\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5199\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u672f\u8bed\u6765\u6307\u4ee3\u5206\u6570\u5bbd\u5ea6/\u9ad8\u5ea6(width/height)\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u7684\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7b49\u4e8e1\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e3a600\u4e14\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e3a5/4\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7b49\u4e8e 600*(5/4)\uff0c\u5373750\u3002</p> <p>\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u9650\u5236\u5982\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\u4e3aleft\u3001right\u3001bottom\u548ctop\uff0c\u5219\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c</p> <pre><code>(right - left) / (top - bottom)\n</code></pre> <p>\u5982\u679c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5219\u5728\u8be5\u77e9\u5f62\u4e2d\u67e5\u770b\u65f6\uff0c\u6c34\u5e73\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5219\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u7578\u53d8\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7531\u65b9\u7a0bx2 + y2 = 9\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5706\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u5728(x,y)\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7684\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e0e\u7ed8\u56fe\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u624d\u6210\u7acb\u3002</p> <p> aspect ratio 1 </p> <p>\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4e00\u4ef6\u574f\u4e8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u5355\u4f4d\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u60a8\u5e0c\u671b\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u9650\u5236left\u3001right\u3001bottom\u548ctop\u7684\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u786e\u5b9e\u5e0c\u671b\u4fdd\u6301\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u663e\u793a\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574left\u548cright\u6216bottom\u548ctop\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\u5339\u914d\uff1a</p> <p> </p> <p>\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u672c\u7ae0\u540e\u9762\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5230\u90a3\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u4e9b\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u3002</p> <p>The aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its width to its height. For example an aspect ratio of 2:1 means that a rectangle is twice as wide as it is tall, and an aspect ratio of 4:3 means that the width is 4/3 times the height. Although aspect ratios are often written in the form width:height, I will use the term to refer to the fraction width/height. A square has aspect ratio equal to 1. A rectangle with aspect ratio 5/4 and height 600 has a width equal to 600*(5/4), or 750.</p> <p>A coordinate system also has an aspect ratio. If the horizontal and vertical limits for the coordinate system are left, right, bottom, and top, as above, then the aspect ratio is the absolute value of</p> <pre><code>(right - left) / (top - bottom)\n</code></pre> <p>If the coordinate system is used on a rectangle with the same aspect ratio, then when viewed in that rectangle, one unit in the horizontal direction will have the same apparent length as a unit in the vertical direction. If the aspect ratios don't match, then there will be some distortion. For example, the shape defined by the equation x2 +y2 = 9 should be a circle, but that will only be true if the aspect ratio of the (x,y) coordinate system matches the aspect ratio of the drawing area.</p> <p> aspect ratio 1 </p> <p>It is not always a bad thing to use different units of length in the vertical and horizontal directions. However, suppose that you want to use coordinates with limits left, right, bottom, and top, and that you do want to preserve the aspect ratio. In that case, depending on the shape of the display rectangle, you might have to adjust the values either of left and right or of bottom and top to make the aspect ratios match:</p> <p> </p> <p>We will look more deeply into geometric transforms later in the chapter, and at that time, we'll see some program code for setting up coordinate systems.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s1/#214--\u989c\u8272\u6a21\u578b","title":"2.1.4  \u989c\u8272\u6a21\u578b","text":"<p>Color Models</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587

One of those is coordinate systems. The other is color. Color is actually a surprisingly complex topic. We will look at some parts of the topic that are most relevant to computer graphics applications.</p> <p>The colors on a computer screen are produced as combinations of red, green, and blue light. Different colors are produced by varying the intensity of each type of light. A color can be specified by three numbers giving the intensity of red, green, and blue in the color. Intensity can be specified as a number in the range zero, for minimum intensity, to one, for maximum intensity. This method of specifying color is called the RGB color model, where RGB stands for Red/Green/Blue. For example, in the RGB color model, the number triple (1, 0.5, 0.5) represents the color obtained by setting red to full intensity, while green and blue are set to half intensity. The red, green, and blue values for a color are called the color components of that color in the RGB color model.</p> <p>Light is made up of waves with a variety of wavelengths. A pure color is one for which all the light has the same wavelength, but in general, a color can contain many wavelengths\u2014mathematically, an infinite number. How then can we represent all colors by combining just red, green, and blue light? In fact, we can't quite do that.</p> <p>You might have heard that combinations of the three basic, or \"primary,\" colors are sufficient to represent all colors, because the human eye has three kinds of color sensors that detect red, green, and blue light. However, that is only an approximation. The eye does contain three kinds of color sensors. The sensors are called \"cone cells.\" However, cone cells do not respond exclusively to red, green, and blue light. Each kind of cone cell responds, to a varying degree, to wavelengths of light in a wide range. A given mix of wavelengths will stimulate each type of cell to a certain degree, and the intensity of stimulation determines the color that we see. A different mixture of wavelengths that stimulates each type of cone cell to the same extent will be perceived as the same color. So a perceived color can, in fact, be specified by three numbers giving the intensity of stimulation of the three types of cone cell. However, it is not possible to produce all possible patterns of stimulation by combining just three basic colors, no matter how those colors are chosen. This is just a fact about the way our eyes actually work; it might have been different. Three basic colors can produce a reasonably large fraction of the set of perceivable colors, but there are colors that you can see in the world that you will never see on your computer screen. (This whole discussion only applies to people who actually have three kinds of cone cell. Color blindness, where someone is missing one or more kinds of cone cell, is surprisingly common.)</p> <p>The range of colors that can be produced by a device such as a computer screen is called the color gamut of that device. Different computer screens can have different color gamuts, and the same RGB values can produce somewhat different colors on different screens. The color gamut of a color printer is noticeably different\u2014and probably smaller\u2014than the color gamut of a screen, which explains why a printed image probably doesn't look exactly the same as it did on the screen. (Printers, by the way, make colors differently from the way a screen does it. Whereas a screen combines light to make a color, a printer combines inks or dyes. Because of this difference, colors meant for printers are often expressed using a different set of basic colors. A common color model for printer colors is CMYK, using the colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.)</p> <p>In any case, the most common color model for computer graphics is RGB. RGB colors are most often represented using 8 bits per color component, a total of 24 bits to represent a color. This representation is sometimes called \"24-bit color.\" An 8-bit number can represent 28, or 256, different values, which we can take to be the positive integers from 0 to 255. A color is then specified as a triple of integers (r,g,b) in that range.</p> <p>This representation works well because 256 shades of red, green, and blue are about as many as the eye can distinguish. In applications where images are processed by computing with color components, it is common to use additional bits per color component to avoid visual effects that might occur due to rounding errors in the computations. Such applications might use a 16-bit integer or even a 32-bit floating point value for each color component. On the other hand, sometimes fewer bits are used. For example, one common color scheme uses 5 bits for the red and blue components and 6 bits for the green component, for a total of 16 bits for a color. (Green gets an extra bit because the eye is more sensitive to green light than to red or blue.) This \"16-bit color\" saves memory compared to 24-bit color and was more common when memory was more expensive.</p> <p>There are many other color models besides RGB. RGB is sometimes criticized as being unintuitive. For example, it's not obvious to most people that yellow is made of a combination of red and green. The closely related color models HSV and HSL describe the same set of colors as RGB, but attempt to do it in a more intuitive way. (HSV is sometimes called HSB, with the \"B\" standing for \"brightness.\" HSV and HSB are exactly the same model.)</p> <p>The \"H\" in these models stands for \"hue,\" a basic spectral color. As H increases, the color changes from red to yellow to green to cyan to blue to magenta, and then back to red. The value of H is often taken to range from 0 to 360, since the colors can be thought of as arranged around a circle with red at both 0 and 360 degrees.</p> <p>The \"S\" in HSV and HSL stands for \"saturation,\" and is taken to range from 0 to 1. A saturation of 0 gives a shade of gray (the shade depending on the value of V or L). A saturation of 1 gives a \"pure color,\" and decreasing the saturation is like adding more gray to the color. \"V\" stands for \"value,\" and \"L\" stands for \"lightness.\" They determine how bright or dark the color is. The main difference is that in the HSV model, the pure spectral colors occur for V=1, while in HSL, they occur for L=0.5.</p> <p>Let's look at some colors in the HSV color model. The illustration below shows colors with a full range of H-values, for S and V equal to 1 and to 0.5. Note that for S=V=1, you get bright, pure colors. S=0.5 gives paler, less saturated colors. V=0.5 gives darker colors.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's probably easier to understand color models by looking at some actual colors and how they are represented. Here is an interactive demo that let's you do that for the RGB and HSV color models:</p> <p></p> <p>Often, a fourth component is added to color models. The fourth component is called alpha, and color models that use it are referred to by names such as RGBA and HSLA. Alpha is not a color as such. It is usually used to represent transparency. A color with maximal alpha value is fully opaque; that is, it is not at all transparent. A color with alpha equal to zero is completely transparent and therefore invisible. Intermediate values give translucent, or partly transparent, colors. Transparency determines what happens when you draw with one color (the foreground color) on top of another color (the background color). If the foreground color is fully opaque, it simply replaces the background color. If the foreground color is partly transparent, then it is blended with the background color. Assuming that the alpha component ranges from 0 to 1, the color that you get can be computed as</p> <pre><code>new_color = (alpha)*(foreground_color) + (1 - alpha)*(background_color)\n</code></pre> <p>This computation is done separately for the red, blue, and green color components. This is called alpha blending. The effect is like viewing the background through colored glass; the color of the glass adds a tint to the background color. This type of blending is not the only possible use of the alpha component, but it is the most common.</p> <p>An RGBA color model with 8 bits per component uses a total of 32 bits to represent a color. This is a convenient number because integer values are often represented using 32-bit values. A 32-bit integer value can be interpreted as a 32-bit RGBA color. How the color components are arranged within a 32-bit integer is somewhat arbitrary. The most common layout is to store the alpha component in the eight high-order bits, followed by red, green, and blue. (This should probably be called ARGB color.) However, other layouts are also in use.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s2/","title":"\u7b2c2\u8282: \u5f62\u72b6","text":"<p>Shapes</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8c08\u8bba\u50cf\u7d20\u548c\u5750\u6807\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u56fe\u5f62\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5fc5\u5728\u6700\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u56fe\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5982\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u548c\u5706\u5f62\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5173\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u8270\u96be\u5de5\u4f5c\u90fd\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5750\u6807\u3002\u5728\u672c\u8282\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u8282\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e9b\u901a\u5e38\u75312D\u56fe\u5f62API\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002</p> <p>We have been talking about low-level graphics concepts like pixels and coordinates, but fortunately we don't usually have to work on the lowest levels.

there will be certain basic shapes that can be drawn with one command, whereas more complex shapes will require multiple commands. Exactly what qualifies as a basic shape varies from one API to another. In the WebGL API, for example, the only basic shapes are points, lines, and triangles. In this subsection, I consider lines, rectangles, and ovals to be basic.</p> <p>By \"line,\" I really mean line segment, that is a straight line segment connecting two given points in the plane. A simple one-pixel-wide line segment, without antialiasing, is the most basic shape. It can be drawn by coloring pixels that lie along the infinitely thin geometric line segment. An algorithm for drawing the line has to decide exactly which pixels to color. One of the first computer graphics algorithms, Bresenham's algorithm for line drawing, implements a very efficient procedure for doing so. I won't discuss such low-level details here, but it's worth looking them up if you want to start learning about what graphics hardware actually has to do on a low level. In any case, lines are typically more complicated. Antialiasing is one complication. Line width is another. A wide line might actually be drawn as a rectangle.</p> <p>Lines can have other attributes, or properties, that affect their appearance. One question is, what should happen at the end of a wide line? Appearance might be improved by adding a rounded \"cap\" on the ends of the line. A square cap\u2014that is, extending the line by half of the line width\u2014might also make sense. Another question is, when two lines meet as part of a larger shape, how should the lines be joined? And many graphics systems support lines that are patterns of dashes and dots. This illustration shows some of the possibilities:</p> <p> <p>On the left are three wide lines with no cap, a round cap, and a square cap. The geometric line segment is shown as a dotted line. (The no-cap style is called \"butt.\") To the right are four lines with different patterns of dots and dashes. In the middle are three different styles of line joins: mitered, rounded, and beveled.</p> <p>The basic rectangular shape has sides that are vertical and horizontal. (A tilted rectangle generally has to be made by applying a rotation.) Such a rectangle can be specified with two points, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), that give the endpoints of one of the diagonals of the rectangle. Alternatively, the width and the height can be given, along with a single base point, (x,y). In that case, the width and height have to be positive, or the rectangle is empty. The base point (x,y) will be the upper left corner of the rectangle if y increases from top to bottom, and it will be the lower left corner of the rectangle if y increases from bottom to top.</p> <p> <p>Suppose that you are given points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), and that you want to draw the rectangle that they determine. And suppose that the only rectangle-drawing command that you have available is one that requires a point (x,y), a width, and a height. For that command, x must be the smaller of x1 and x2, and the width can be computed as the absolute value of x1 minus x2. And similarly for y and the height. In pseudocode,</p> <pre><code>DrawRectangle from points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2):\n    x = min( x1, x2 )\n    y = min( y1, y2 )\n    width = abs( x1 - x2 )\n    height = abs( y1 - y2 )\n    DrawRectangle( x, y, width, height )\n</code></pre> <p>A common variation on rectangles is to allow rounded corners. For a \"round rect,\" the corners are replaced by elliptical arcs. The degree of rounding can be specified by giving the horizontal radius and vertical radius of the ellipse. Here are some examples of round rects. For the shape at the right, the two radii of the ellipse are shown:</p> <p> <p>My final basic shape is the oval. (An oval is also called an ellipse.) An oval is a closed curve that has two radii. For a basic oval, we assume that the radii are vertical and horizontal. An oval with this property can be specified by giving the rectangle that just contains it. Or it can be specified by giving its center point and the lengths of its vertical radius and its horizontal radius. In this illustration, the oval on the left is shown with its containing rectangle and with its center point and radii:</p> <p> <p>The oval on the right is a circle. A circle is just an oval in which the two radii have the same length.</p> <p>If ovals are not available as basic shapes, they can be approximated by drawing a large number of line segments. The number of lines that is needed for a good approximation depends on the size of the oval. It's useful to know how to do this. Suppose that an oval has center point (x,y), horizontal radius r1, and vertical radius r2. Mathematically, the points on the oval are given by</p> <pre><code>( x + r1*cos(angle), y + r2*sin(angle) )\n</code></pre> <p>where angle takes on values from 0 to 360 if angles are measured in degrees or from 0 to 2\u03c0 if they are measured in radians. Here sin and cos are the standard sine and cosine functions. To get an approximation for an oval, we can use this formula to generate some number of points and then connect those points with line segments. In pseudocode, assuming that angles are measured in radians and that pi represents the mathematical constant \u03c0,</p> <pre><code>Draw Oval with center (x,y), horizontal radius r1, and vertical radius r2:\n    for i = 0 to numberOfLines:\n        angle1 = i * (2*pi/numberOfLines)\n        angle2 = (i+1) * (2*pi/numberOfLines)\n        a1 = x + r1*cos(angle1)\n        b1 = y + r2*sin(angle1)\n        a2 = x + r1*cos(angle2)\n        b2 = y + r2*sin(angle2)\n        Draw Line from (a1,b1) to (a2,b2)\n</code></pre> <p>For a circle, of course, you would just have r1 = r2. This is the first time we have used the sine and cosine functions, but it won't be the last. These functions play an important role in computer graphics because of their association with circles, circular motion, and rotation. We will meet them again when we talk about transforms in the next section.</p> <p>Here's a little demo that you can use to experiment with using line segments to approximate ovals:</p>

<p> </p> <p>There are two ways to make a shape visible in a drawing. You can stroke it. Or, if it is a closed shape such as a rectangle or an oval, you can fill it. Stroking a line is like dragging a pen along the line. Stroking a rectangle or oval is like dragging a pen along its boundary. Filling a shape means coloring all the points that are contained inside that shape. It's possible to both stroke and fill the same shape; in that case, the interior of the shape and the outline of the shape can have a different appearance.</p> <p>When a shape intersects itself, like the two shapes in the illustration below, it's not entirely clear what should count as the interior of the shape. In fact, there are at least two different rules for filling such a shape. Both are based on something called the winding number. The winding number of a shape about a point is, roughly, how many times the shape winds around the point in the positive direction, which I take here to be counterclockwise. Winding number can be negative when the winding is in the opposite direction. In the illustration, the shapes on the left are traced in the direction shown, and the winding number about each region is shown as a number inside the region.</p> <p> </p> <p>The shapes are also shown filled using the two fill rules. For the shapes in the center, the fill rule is to color any region that has a non-zero winding number. For the shapes shown on the right, the rule is to color any region whose winding number is odd; regions with even winding number are not filled.</p> <p>There is still the question of what a shape should be filled with. Of course, it can be filled with a color, but other types of fill are possible, including patterns and gradients. A pattern is an image, usually a small image. When used to fill a shape, a pattern can be repeated horizontally and vertically as necessary to cover the entire shape. A gradient is similar in that it is a way for color to vary from point to point, but instead of taking the colors from an image, they are computed. There are a lot of variations to the basic idea, but there is always a line segment along which the color varies. The color is specified at the endpoints of the line segment, and possibly at additional points; between those points, the color is interpolated. The color can also be extrapolated to other points on the line that contains the line segment but lying outside the line segment; this can be done either by repeating the pattern from the line segment or by simply extending the color from the nearest endpoint. For a linear gradient, the color is constant along lines perpendicular to the basic line segment, so you get lines of solid color going in that direction. In a radial gradient, the color is constant along circles centered at one of the endpoints of the line segment. And that doesn't exhaust the possibilities. To give you an idea what patterns and gradients can look like, here is a shape, filled with two gradients and two patterns:</p> <p> </p> <p>The first shape is filled with a simple linear gradient defined by just two colors, while the second shape uses a radial gradient.</p> <p>Patterns and gradients are not necessarily restricted to filling shapes. Stroking a shape is, after all, the same as filling a band of pixels along the boundary of the shape, and that can be done with a gradient or a pattern, instead of with a solid color.</p> <p>Finally, I will mention that a string of text can be considered to be a shape for the purpose of drawing it. The boundary of the shape is the outline of the characters. The text is drawn by filling that shape. In some graphics systems, it is also possible to stroke the outline of the shape that defines the text. In the following illustration, the string \"Graphics\" is shown, on top, filled with a pattern and, below that, filled with a gradient and stroked with solid black:</p> <p>

<p></p> <p>It is impossible for a graphics API to include every possible shape as a basic shape, but there is usually some way to create more complex shapes. For example, consider polygons. A polygon is a closed shape consisting of a sequence of line segments. Each line segment is joined to the next at its endpoint, and the last line segment connects back to the first. The endpoints are called the vertices of the polygon, and a polygon can be defined by listing its vertices.</p> <p>In a regular polygon, all the sides are the same length and all the angles between sides are equal. Squares and equilateral triangles are examples of regular polygons. A convex polygon has the property that whenever two points are inside or on the polygon, then the entire line segment between those points is also inside or on the polygon. Intuitively, a convex polygon has no \"indentations\" along its boundary. (Concavity can be a property of any shape, not just of polygons.)</p> <p> </p> <p>Sometimes, polygons are required to be \"simple,\" meaning that the polygon has no self-intersections. That is, all the vertices are different, and a side can only intersect another side at its endpoints. And polygons are usually required to be \"planar,\" meaning that all the vertices lie in the same plane. (Of course, in 2D graphics, everything lies in the same plane, so this is not an issue. However, it does become an issue in 3D.)</p> <p>How then should we draw polygons? That is, what capabilities would we like to have in a graphics API for drawing them. One possibility is to have commands for stroking and for filling polygons, where the vertices of the polygon are given as an array of points or as an array of x-coordinates plus an array of y-coordinates. In fact, that is sometimes done; for example, the Java graphics API includes such commands. Another, more flexible, approach is to introduce the idea of a \"path.\" Java, SVG, and the HTML canvas API all support this idea. A path is a general shape that can include both line segments and curved segments. Segments can, but don't have to be, connected to other segments at their endpoints. A path is created by giving a series of commands that tell, essentially, how a pen would be moved to draw the path. While a path is being created, there is a point that represents the pen's current location. There will be a command for moving the pen without drawing, and commands for drawing various kinds of segments. For drawing polygons, we need commands such as</p> <ul> <li><code>createPath()</code> \u2014 start a new, empty path</li> <li><code>moveTo(x,y)</code> \u2014 move the pen to the point (x,y), without adding a segment to the path; that is, without drawing anything</li> <li><code>lineTo(x,y)</code> \u2014 add a line segment to the path that starts at the current pen location and ends at the point (x,y), and move the pen to (x,y)</li> <li><code>closePath()</code> \u2014 add a line segment from the current pen location back to the starting point, unless the pen is already there, producing a closed path.</li> </ul> <p>(For closePath, I need to define \"starting point.\" A path can be made up of \"subpaths\" A subpath consists of a series of connected segments. A moveTo always starts a new subpath. A closePath ends the current segment and implicitly starts a new one. So \"starting point\" means the position of the pen after the most recent moveTo or closePath.)</p> <p>Suppose that we want a path that represents the triangle with vertices at (100,100), (300,100), and (200, 200). We can do that with the commands</p> <pre><code>createPath()\nmoveTo( 100, 100 )\nlineTo( 300, 100 )\nlineTo( 200, 200 )\nclosePath()\n</code></pre> <p>The closePath command at the end could be replaced by lineTo(100,100), to move the pen back to the first vertex.</p> <p>A path represents an abstract geometric object. Creating one does not make it visible on the screen. Once we have a path, to make it visible we need additional commands for stroking and filling the path.</p> <p>Earlier in this section, we saw how to approximate an oval by drawing, in effect, a polygon with a large number of sides. In that example, I drew each side as a separate line segment, so we really had a bunch of separate lines rather than a polygon. There is no way to fill such a thing. It would be better to approximate the oval with a polygonal path. For an oval with center (x,y) and radii r1 and r2:</p> <pre><code>createPath()\nmoveTo( x + r1, y )\nfor i = 1 to numberOfPoints-1\n    angle = i * (2*pi/numberOfLines)\n    lineTo( x + r1*cos(angle), y + r2*sin(angle) )\nclosePath()\n</code></pre> <p>Using this path, we could draw a filled oval as well as stroke it. Even if we just want to draw the outline of a polygon, it's still better to create the polygon as a path rather than to draw the line segments as separate sides. With a path, the computer knows that the sides are part of single shape. This makes it possible to control the appearance of the \"join\" between consecutive sides, as noted earlier in this section.</p> <p>I noted above that a path can contain other kinds of segments besides lines. For example, it might be possible to include an arc of a circle as a segment. Another type of curve is a Bezier curve. Bezier curves can be used to create very general curved shapes. They are fairly intuitive, so that they are often used in programs that allow users to design curves interactively. Mathematically, Bezier curves are defined by parametric polynomial equations, but you don't need to understand what that means to use them. There are two kinds of Bezier curve in common use, cubic Bezier curves and quadratic Bezier curves; they are defined by cubic and quadratic polynomials respectively. When the general term \"Bezier curve\" is used, it usually refers to cubic Bezier curves.</p> <p>A cubic Bezier curve segment is defined by the two endpoints of the segment together with two control points. To understand how it works, it's best to think about how a pen would draw the curve segment. The pen starts at the first endpoint, headed in the direction of the first control point. The distance of the control point from the endpoint controls the speed of the pen as it starts drawing the curve. The second control point controls the direction and speed of the pen as it gets to the second endpoint of the curve. There is a unique cubic curve that satisfies these conditions.</p> <p> </p> <p>The illustration above shows three cubic Bezier curve segments. The two curve segments on the right are connected at an endpoint to form a longer curve. The curves are drawn as thick black lines. The endpoints are shown as black dots and the control points as blue squares, with a thin red line connecting each control point to the corresponding endpoint. (Ordinarily, only the curve would be drawn, except in an interface that lets the user edit the curve by hand.) Note that at an endpoint, the curve segment is tangent to the line that connects the endpoint to the control point. Note also that there can be a sharp point or corner where two curve segments meet. However, one segment will merge smoothly into the next if control points are properly chosen.</p> <p>This will all be easier to understand with some hands-on experience. This interactive demo lets you edit cubic Bezier curve segments by dragging their endpoints and control points:</p> <p></p> <p>When a cubic Bezier curve segment is added to a path, the path's current pen location acts as the first endpoint of the segment. The command for adding the segment to the path must specify the two control points and the second endpoint. A typical command might look like</p> <pre><code>cubicCurveTo( cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2, x, y )\n</code></pre> <p>This would add a curve from the current location to point (x,y), using (cx1,cy1) and (cx2,cy2) as the control points. That is, the pen leaves the current location heading towards (cx1,cy1), and it ends at the point (x,y), arriving there from the direction of (cx2,cy2).</p> <p>Quadratic Bezier curve segments are similar to the cubic version, but in the quadratic case, there is only one control point for the segment. The curve leaves the first endpoint heading in the direction of the control point, and it arrives at the second endpoint coming from the direction of the control point. The curve in this case will be an arc of a parabola.</p> <p>Again, this is easier to understand this with some hands-on experience.

This rectangle will be called the viewport. We also have a set of geometric objects that are defined in a possibly different coordinate system, generally one that uses real-number coordinates rather than integers. These objects make up the \"scene\" or \"world\" that we want to view, and the coordinates that we use to define the scene are called world coordinates.</p> <p>For 2D graphics, the world lies in a plane. It's not possible to show a picture of the entire infinite plane. We need to pick some rectangular area in the plane to display in the image. Let's call that rectangular area the window, or view window. A coordinate transform is used to map the window to the viewport.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this illustration, T represents the coordinate transformation. T is a function that takes world coordinates (x,y) in some window and maps them to pixel coordinates T(x,y) in the viewport. (I've drawn the viewport and window with different sizes to emphasize that they are not the same thing, even though they show the same objects, but in fact they don't even exist in the same space, so it doesn't really make sense to compare their sizes.) In this example, as you can check,</p> <pre><code>T(x,y) = ( 800*(x+4)/8, 600*(3-y)/6 )\n</code></pre> <p>Look at the rectangle with corners at (-1,2) and (3,-1) in the window. When this rectangle is displayed in the viewport, it is displayed as the rectangle with corners T(-1,2) and T(3,-1). In this example, T(-1,2) = (300,100) and T(3,-1) = (700,400).</p> <p>We use coordinate transformations in this way because it allows us to choose a world coordinate system that is natural for describing the scene that we want to display, and it is easier to do that than to work directly with viewport coordinates. Along the same lines, suppose that we want to define some complex object, and suppose that there will be several copies of that object in our scene. Or maybe we are making an animation, and we would like the object to have different positions in different frames. We would like to choose some convenient coordinate system and use it to define the object once and for all. The coordinates that we use to define an object are called object coordinates for the object. When we want to place the object into a scene, we need to transform the object coordinates that we used to define the object into the world coordinate system that we are using for the scene. The transformation that we need is called a modeling transformation. This picture illustrates an object defined in its own object coordinate system and then mapped by three different modeling transformations into the world coordinate system:</p> <p> </p> <p>Remember that in order to view the scene, there will be another transformation that maps the object from a view window in world coordinates into the viewport.</p> <p>Now, keep in mind that the choice of a view window tells which part of the scene is shown in the image. Moving, resizing, or even rotating the window will give a different view of the scene. Suppose we make several images of the same car:</p> <p> </p> <p>What happened between making the top image in this illustration and making the image on the bottom left? In fact, there are two possibilities: Either the car was moved to the right, or the view window that defines the scene was moved to the left. This is important, so be sure you understand it. (Try it with your cell phone camera. Aim it at some objects, take a step to the left, and notice what happens to the objects in the camera's viewfinder: They move to the right in the picture!) Similarly, what happens between the top picture and the middle picture on the bottom? Either the car rotated counterclockwise, or the window was rotated clockwise. (Again, try it with a camera\u2014you might want to take two actual photos so that you can compare them.) Finally, the change from the top picture to the one on the bottom right could happen because the car got smaller or because the window got larger. (On your camera, a bigger window means that you are seeing a larger field of view, and you can get that by applying a zoom to the camera or by backing up away from the objects that you are viewing.)</p> <p>There is an important general idea here. When we modify the view window, we change the coordinate system that is applied to the viewport. But in fact, this is the same as leaving that coordinate system in place and moving the objects in the scene instead. Except that to get the same effect in the final image, you have to apply the opposite transformation to the objects (for example, moving the window to the left is equivalent to moving the objects to the right). So, there is no essential distinction between transforming the window and transforming the object. Mathematically, you specify a geometric primitive by giving coordinates in some natural coordinate system, and the computer applies a sequence of transformations to those coordinates to produce, in the end, the coordinates that are used to actually draw the primitive in the image. You will think of some of those transformations as modeling transforms and some as coordinate transforms, but to the computer, it's all the same.</p> <p>Here is a live demo that can help you to understand the equivalence between modeling transformations and viewport transformations. The sliders control transformations that are applied to the objects in the picture. In the lower section of the demo, you see a larger view in which the viewport for the upper image is represented as a translucent black rectangle. Read the help text in the demo for more information.</p> <p></p> <p>We will return to this idea several times later in the book, but in any case, you can see that geometric transforms are a central concept in computer graphics. Let's look at some basic types of transformation in more detail. The transforms we will use in 2D graphics can be written in the form</p> <pre><code>x1 = a*x + b*y + e\ny1 = c*x + d*y + f\n</code></pre> <p>where (x,y) represents the coordinates of some point before the transformation is applied, and (x1,y1) are the transformed coordinates. The transform is defined by the six constants a, b, c, d, e, and f. Note that this can be written as a function T, where</p> <pre><code>T(x,y) = ( a*x + b*y + e, c*x + d*y + f )\n</code></pre> <p>A transformation of this form is called an affine transform. An affine transform has the property that, when it is applied to two parallel lines, the transformed lines will also be parallel. Also, if you follow one affine transform by another affine transform, the result is again an affine transform.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s3/#232--translation","title":"2.3.2  Translation","text":"<p>Translation</p> \u4e2d\u6587\u82f1\u6587 <p>A translation transform simply moves every point by a certain amount horizontally and a certain amount vertically.

(Thus for a translation, a = d = 1, and b = c = 0 in the general formula for an affine transform.) A 2D graphics system will typically have a function such as\n\n```text\ntranslate( e, f )\n</code></pre> <p>to apply a translate transformation. The translation would apply to everything that is drawn after the command is given. That is, for all subsequent drawing operations, e would be added to the x-coordinate and f would be added to the y-coordinate. Let's look at an example. Suppose that you draw an \"F\" using coordinates in which the \"F\" is centered at (0,0). If you say translate(4,2) before drawing the \"F\", then every point of the \"F\" will be moved horizontally by 4 units and vertically by 2 units before the coordinates are actually used, so that after the translation, the \"F\" will be centered at (4,2):</p> <p> </p> <p>The light gray \"F\" in this picture shows what would be drawn without the translation; the dark red \"F\" shows the same \"F\" drawn after applying a translation by (4,2). The top arrow shows that the upper left corner of the \"F\" has been moved over 4 units and up 2 units. Every point in the \"F\" is subjected to the same displacement. Note that in my examples, I am assuming that the y-coordinate increases from bottom to top. That is, the y-axis points up.</p> <p>Remember that when you give the command translate(e,f), the translation applies to all the drawing that you do after that, not just to the next shape that you draw. If you apply another transformation after the translation, the second transform will not replace the translation. It will be combined with the translation, so that subsequent drawing will be affected by the combined transformation. For example, if you combine translate(4,2) with translate(-1,5), the result is the same as a single translation, translate(3,7). This is an important point, and there will be a lot more to say about it later.</p> <p>Also remember that you don't compute coordinate transformations yourself. You just specify the original coordinates for the object (that is, the object coordinates), and you specify the transform or transforms that are to be applied.

A rotation with a positive angle rotates objects in the direction from the positive x-axis towards the positive y-axis. This is counterclockwise in a coordinate system where the y-axis points up, as it does in my examples here, but it is clockwise in the usual pixel coordinates, where the y-axis points down rather than up.

The translation will then apply to all subsequent drawing. But, because of the rotation command, the things that you draw after the translation are rotated objects. That is, the translation applies to objects that have already been rotated. An example is shown on the left in the illustration below, where the light gray \"F\" is the original shape, and red \"F\" shows the result of applying the two transforms to the original.

We can do this by first moving the point (p,q) to the origin, using translate(-p,-q). Then we can do a standard rotation about the origin by calling rotate(r). Finally, we can move the origin back to the point (p,q) by applying translate(p,q).

In fact, the true description of a scaling operation is that it pushes every point away from (0,0) or pulls every point towards (0,0). If you want to scale about a point other than (0,0), you can use a sequence of three transforms, similar to what was done in the case of rotation.</p> <p>A 2D graphics API can provide a function scale(a,d) for applying scaling transformations. As usual, the transform applies to all x and y coordinates in subsequent drawing operations. Note that negative scaling factors are allowed and will result in reflecting the shape as well as possibly stretching or shrinking it. For example, scale(1,-1) will reflect objects vertically, through the x-axis.</p> <p>It is a fact that every affine transform can be created by combining translations, rotations about the origin, and scalings about the origin.

I'll assume here that the view window is not rotated; that it, its sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes. In that case, the window-to-viewport transformation can be expressed in terms of translation and scaling transforms. Let's look at the typical case where the viewport has pixel coordinates ranging from 0 on the left to width on the right and from 0 at the top to height at the bottom. And assume that the limits on the view window are left, right, bottom, and top. In that case, the window-to-viewport transformation can be programmed as:</p> <pre><code>scale( width / (right-left), height / (bottom-top) );\ntranslate( -left, -top )\n</code></pre> <p>These should be the last transforms that are applied to a point. Since transforms are applied to points in the reverse of the order in which they are specified in the program, they should be the first transforms that are specified in the program.

Several modeling transforms might have already been applied to the object to produce the point (x,y), and that point is now ready for its final transformation into viewport coordinates.)

Recall that a matrix, from the point of view of a computer scientist, is a two-dimensional array of numbers, while a vector is a one-dimensional array. Matrices and vectors are studied in the field of mathematics called linear algebra. Linear algebra is fundamental to computer graphics. In fact, matrix and vector math is built into GPUs. You won't need to know a great deal about linear algebra for this textbook, but a few basic ideas are essential.</p> <p>The vectors that we need are lists of two, three, or four numbers. They are often written as (x,y), (x,y,z), and (x,y,z,w). A matrix with N rows and M columns is called an \"N-by-M matrix.\" For the most part, the matrices that we need are N-by-N matrices, where N is 2, 3, or 4. That is, they have 2, 3, or 4 rows and columns, and the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.</p> <p>If A and B are two N-by-N matrices, then they can be multiplied to give a product matrix C = AB. If A is an N-by-N matrix, and v is a vector of length N, then v can be multiplied by A to give another vector w = Av. The function that takes v to Av is a transformation; it transforms any given vector of size N into another vector of size N. A transformation of this form is called a linear transformation.</p> <p>Now, suppose that A and B are N-by-N matrices and v is a vector of length N. Then, we can form two different products: A(Bv) and (AB)v. It is a central fact that these two operations have the same effect. That is, we can multiply v by B and then multiply the result by A, or we can multiply the matrices A and B to get the matrix product AB and then multiply v by AB. The result is the same.</p> <p>Rotation and scaling, as it turns out, are linear transformations. That is, the operation of rotating (x,y) through an angle d about the origin can be done by multiplying (x,y) by a 2-by-2 matrix. Let's call that matrix Rd. Similarly, scaling by a factor a in the horizontal direction and b in the vertical direction can be given as a matrix Sa,b. If we want to apply a scaling followed by a rotation to the point v = (x,y), we can compute either Rd(Sa,b^v) or (RdSa,b)v.</p> <p>So what? Well, suppose that we want to apply the same two operations, scale then rotate, to thousands of points, as we typically do when transforming objects for computer graphics. The point is that we could compute the product matrix RdSa,b once and for all, and then apply the combined transform to each point with a single multiplication. This means that if a program says</p> <pre><code>rotate(d)\nscale(a,b)\n.\n.  // draw a complex object\n.\n</code></pre> <p>the computer doesn't have to keep track of two separate operations. It combines the operations into a single matrix and just keeps track of that. Even if you apply, say, 50 transformations to the object, the computer can just combine them all into one matrix. By using matrix algebra, multiple transformations can be handled as efficiently as a single transformation!</p> <p>This is really nice, but there is a gaping problem: Translation is not a linear transformation. To bring translation into this framework, we do something that looks a little strange at first: Instead of representing a point in 2D as a pair of numbers (x,y), we represent it as the triple of numbers (x,y,1). That is, we add a one as the third coordinate. It then turns out that we can then represent rotation, scaling, and translation\u2014and hence any affine transformation\u2014on 2D space as multiplication by a 3-by-3 matrix. The matrices that we need have a bottom row containing (0,0,1). Multiplying (x,y,1) by such a matrix gives a new vector (x1,y1,1). We ignore the extra coordinate and consider this to be a transformation of (x,y) into (x1,y1). For the record, the 3-by-3 matrices for translation (Ta,b), scaling (Sa,b), and rotation (Rd) in 2D are</p> <p> </p> <p>You can compare multiplication by these matrices to the formulas given above for translation, scaling, and rotation. But when doing graphics programming, you won't need to do the multiplication yourself. For now, the important idea that you should take away from this discussion is that a sequence of transformations can be combined into a single transformation. The computer only needs to keep track of a single matrix, which we can call the \"current matrix\" or \"current transformation.\" To implement transform commands such as translate(a,b) or rotate(d), the computer simply multiplies the current matrix by the matrix that represents the transform.</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s4/","title":"\u7b2c4\u8282: \u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21","text":"<p>Hierarchical Modeling</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s5/","title":"\u7b2c5\u8282: Java Graphics2D","text":"<p>Java Graphics2D</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s6/","title":"\u7b2c6\u8282: HTML Canvas\u56fe\u5f62","text":"<p>HTML Canvas Graphics</p>"},{"location":"cn/c2/s7/","title":"\u7b2c7\u8282: SVG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bed\u8a00","text":"<p>SVG: A Scene Description Language</p>"}]}
