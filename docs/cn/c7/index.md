# 第 7 章： 使用 WebGL 进行 3D 图形

**3D Graphics with WebGL**

=== "中文"

    The previous chapter covered WebGL, but only in the context of two-dimensional graphics. As we move into 3D, we will have to work with more complex transformations. For that, we will rely mainly on an open-source JavaScript library for vector and matrix math. We will also need to implement lighting and material, which we will do directly in GLSL.

    We begin the chapter by duplicating most of the capabilities of OpenGL 1.1 that were covered in [Chapter 3](../c3/index.md) and [Chapter 4](../c4/index.md). But we will soon move beyond that by adding features such as spotlights, Phong shading, and environment mapping.
